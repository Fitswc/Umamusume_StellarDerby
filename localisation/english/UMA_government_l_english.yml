 civic_umamihonobourbon:0 "Bourbon powered solar furnace"
 civic_umamihonobourbon_desc:0 "At the age of 10, Mihono Bourbon, known as a genius mechanic, was nearly killed by the wild machinery of the experiment to protect her best friend. When she awoke from her coma and unrealistically stroked her cheek, the cold touch instantly brought her to consciousness. To save her, scientists had to top the extremely low fit to the mechanical transformation of Bourbon's body, and the result was astonishingly successful. The past of the previous decade was taken away by the machinery, and the future of the future was given by the machinery. Her affinity with machinery gave Bourbon a new level of ability and understanding as a mechanic, and she became the leader of the mechanical industry in that era, and her research into the powered solar furnace had a profound impact in the later era of exploration of the stars."
 civic_umasymbolirudolf:0 "Symboli Rudolf's Interstellar Student Union"
 civic_umasymbolirudolf_desc:0 "She was a natural leader, a fact that would have been acutely felt by any Umamusume who knew Rudolf. This talent was demonstrated in her childhood, and when she entered the doors of Tresen with excellent grades in many areas and was undoubtedly elected student president, a new era was destined to dawn, a new era for the legend who was given the name "Emperor". With a bang in the year 2200, the ship with the FTL engine disappeared into the universe and opened the curtain of the Star River Era. Rudolf became the first student chairman of this initial civilization to enter the universe, and is destined to carve the glory of the Umamusume civilization in the history of the universe."
 civic_umaagnestachyon:0 "The scientific dominance of Agnes Tachyon"
 civic_umaagnestachyon_desc:0 "First of all, for the record, the scientist Agnes Tachyon has not been heard from for four years after resigning from her position, so if anyone gets a clue about her anywhere, please report it at the first opportunity. Genius is a term that was perhaps coined to describe Agnes Tachyon. The children were curious about this maverick peer, but intimidated by the "science" she often poured out on them, which they knew nothing about. In the 12th year of her lonely life, Agnes Tachyon met a Umamusume who was willing to enter her heart. Perhaps it was because she was the first person of her age to talk to her, or perhaps she was even willing to accompany each other as her experimental subjects ...... In any case, from then on, experimentation gradually began to cease to be all that Sachiko had. Then one day at sunset, Umamusume made a pact with Tachyon - when you become the greatest scientist in the world, I will prepare a gift for you."
