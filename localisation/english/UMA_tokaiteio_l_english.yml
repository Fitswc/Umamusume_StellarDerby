Everyone was paying close attention to the vital signs of the little Umamusume in the cabin.

 uma_tokaiteio_event.108.desc: "The scientific department sent a research report on the addictiveness of sugar alcohols. The report pointed out that the addictiveness comes from a microorganism that can reproduce in sugar alcohols. When the sugar alcohols remain in the original state or contain only a small amount of water, the microorganism will enter a dormant state. When the water content is too high, the microorganism will reproduce in large numbers and then affect the nervous system. \nIn the last attachment of the report, the scientific department mentioned that the Umamusume who discovered that drinking thick honey would not produce withdrawal reactions was the Tokai Teio. \nSo, the sugar alcohol withdrawal crisis was quickly resolved with the Teio's discovery. These sugar alcohols were prohibited from being sold in the form of beverages, but could only be sold in the form of crystals and syrups, and then diluted with water as needed before drinking."

 uma_tokaiteio_event.1004.desc: "队员们总算进入了建筑主体，它仍然保持着供能，在探测到队员们进入的同时，它便在度运转了起来，组内的科学家们熟练地按照危险排除预案等待安全专家排除危险后，便迫不及待地涌入了建筑。这个房间似乎是什么设备的控制室，一个发光的全息控制终端悬浮在大厅中央，破译组开始了她们的工作，其他成员则尝试寻找一些线索。"  <"The team members finally entered the main building. It was still powered. When it detected the team members entering, it started to operate at high speed. The scientists in the team skillfully followed the danger elimination plan and waited for the safety experts to eliminate the danger. Then they rushed into the building impatiently. This room seemed to be the control room of some equipment. A glowing holographic control terminal was suspended in the center of the hall. The decryption team began their work, and other members tried to find some clues."

 uma_tokaiteio_event.1005.desc: "破译工作几乎没有遇到什么阻碍，这个控制终端便被我们完全掌控了，它一共控制着三个部位：系团级跃迁引擎；糖醇合成器；基因库。其中，安置跃迁引擎和基因库都已经被恶劣环境摧毁，但糖醇合成器依然在数十万年间以最高功率不间断地运行着，形成了[event_target:tokaiteio_star_target.GetName]上满是糖醇的大气层。现在，我们只需要把糖醇合成器单独拆分出来就好了。"  <"The decoding work encountered almost no obstacles, and we had full control of this control terminal, which controls three parts in total: the system-level jump engine; the sugar alcohol synthesizer; and the gene library. Among them, the jump engine and the gene library have been destroyed by the harsh environment, but the sugar alcohol synthesizer has been running at the highest power for hundreds of thousands of years, forming an atmosphere full of sugar alcohols on [event_target:tokaiteio_star_target.GetName]. Now, we just need to separate the sugar alcohol synthesizer."
 uma_tokaiteio_event.1006.name: "Sleeping..."
 uma_tokaiteio_event.1006.desc: "The team members found something unexpected next to the sugar alcohol synthesizer: a young Umamusume. She was sleeping quietly in the hibernation chamber, and no one knew how many years had passed. The sudden appearance of other Umamusume species shocked everyone involved in the project. The news was reported to the higher authorities and then classified as confidential. The team first moved the Umamusume and the entire hibernation chamber onto the exploration ship and quickly sent it to the center of Traincent. They also increased the search intensity of the entire ruins. At the same time, the organization of the control terminal database was also sent to the research department as an urgent project."
 uma_tokaiteio_event.1007.name: "A seed"
 uma_tokaiteio_event.1007.desc: "Scientists have sorted out the source of the entire ruins from a large amount of redundant data: this Umamusume civilization was attacked by invaders and fell into war and was at a disadvantage. In order to continue the race, they launched several batches of special colony ships carrying factor libraries, fertilized eggs and some social elites to the young star cluster. It was affected by an unknown gravitational source during a long-distance jump and then collided with [event_target:tokaiteio_star_target.GetName]. All jump engines and most of the hull were destroyed, leaving only a solid control cabin and reactor. As for the sugar alcohol synthesizer, in addition to being edible, it can also be used to block most detections. The impact and the explosion of the reactor changed the orbit of this primitive planet at the time. It entered a reverse orbit and eventually became a hot gas planet close to the star. According to the database, the last thing this unknown little Umamusume did before entering the hibernation cabin was to take a cup of 83 sugar alcohol from the sugar alcohol synthesizer, and then lie down in the hibernation cabin nearby, which saved her from the impact, but the built-in thawing system has been damaged. We must re-study this hibernation system and develop a matching thawing device."

It was preliminarily determined to be a low-toxic sweet solid at room temperature. Samples have been sent to the Traincent Central Laboratory, and further research on the properties of the substance is underway."
