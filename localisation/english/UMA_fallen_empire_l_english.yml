###外交对话###
01_UMA_FALLEN_NEUTRAL:0 "Stay! tuned! We will be watching your growth continuously and closely. In the several generations of Umamusume civilizations born before you, some of them became a dominant party; there were also Oneworld enterprises that forced open each other's markets and dumped their products. But most of them are only fleeting, how bright they were in life, they will not shine much after death, I hope you will not follow in their footsteps. In this era of the stars, live to talk about the subsequent development."
02_UMA_FALLEN_NEUTRAL:0 "Interesting! Your entertainment industry ...... Quite intriguing. We haven't thought of making the image of the highly popular Sai Umamusumes into small dolls in such a way. How did we show Sai Umamusume's high popularity and power? We just thought:'Put up a statue of her with great majesty! The statue will be placed solemnly in our important places for people to admire, and that's all."
03_UMA_FALLEN_NEUTRAL:0 "Frank! Looking at it carefully, I always feel that we are quite close, as we should be. When I look at you, it is like looking in the mirror and remembering myself when I was young, even though the situations we encountered and faced were not quite the same, we are still generally similar. This memory is very precious."
04_UMA_FALLEN_NEUTRAL:0 "Effort! It's hard for Umamusume to survive in this universe. I hope you guys do well and once again spread Umamusume's footsteps across the galaxy!"
05_UMA_FALLEN_NEUTRAL:0 "Sigh! To see an Umamusume civilization like yours again after all these years... Be well and don't follow in our footsteps..."
01_UMA_FALLEN_PATRONIZING:0 "Surprise! Look, aren't these the little guys from [Root.GetName]? So, is there something you want to talk to us about now? Whether it's something strange you've come across in some star field or something you've unearthed from some relic, you can tell us about it. We are happy to be your listeners."
02_UMA_FALLEN_PATRONIZING:0 "Doubtful! Did something happen? Did something go wrong with the holiday gifts we gave you? Or was there a missing number of arrivals? No? Well ..... That's good, we don't want to see your little chilly faces. That would make us feel bad!"
03_UMA_FALLEN_PATRONIZING:0 "Attention! If you are short of construction workers, we may be able to send a group of workers to you, and if you have any needs, just mention them. Don't be afraid that our workers will find it complicated to understand, they are the best craftsmen in the whole galaxy, and now I am putting them in your hands for the time being. Are you happy? If you're happy, just say it back to us."
04_UMA_FALLEN_PATRONIZING:0 "Question! What's the matter, ponies? Why the sullen look? Are you bored and helpless from the constant harassment of your neighboring civilizations? Listen ...... We'll be sending a diplomatic mission to their capital in a few minutes to negotiate with them, and if they won't stop their behavior and apologize to you, then they know the consequences ......"
05_UMA_FALLEN_PATRONIZING:0 "Care! Our Classic Series is also underway, you have a lot of players here ...... But our players aren't just a bunch of dudes, so watch out. We look forward to seeing how well you guys do in this series and let's see how far your potential can go."
01_UMA_FALLEN_DISMISSIVE:0 "What? What are you doing here on purpose with your stinky faces? We are willing to build our products on a backward civilization and a backward planet ruled by your backward system, and all you have to do is bow your heads and be grateful to us!"
02_UMA_FALLEN_DISMISSIVE:0 "How about next time you don't send players here? Your Classic Series results in our place are not good. ...... Don't lose all your civic confidence!"
01_UMA_FALLEN_ANGRY:0 "What do you still want from us? We are no longer involved, the supplies and knowledge we have given you are to be fed to the wild Leviathan! Now take the trophies you have won from us and leave!"
02_UMA_FALLEN_ANGRY:0 "We treat you as our flesh and blood, selflessly sharing our experience and knowledge, but you treat our feelings with cruelty. Just ask, what mother raises her children to be rewarded?"
03_UMA_FALLEN_ANGRY:0 "If the Three Goddesses were present, they would have spurned your deeds. Even if you are also His creatures."
01_UMA_FALLEN_WAR_GREEING:0 "There are only two kinds of running in Umamusumes:either running to the end of the track with all your might or running to the enemy with the will to die!"
02_UMA_FALLEN_WAR_GREEING:0 "Please let us see if your new generation Umamusume can replace us ......"
03_UMA_FALLEN_WAR_GREEING:0 "Although we abhor the practice of hand-to-hand combat, we don't mind cleaning up after you who have fallen astray and refuse to return. Even if the Three Goddesses would not want this to happen ......"
