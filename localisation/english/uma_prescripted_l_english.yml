 START_SCREEN_ROT: "The Umamusume, born on the beautiful Earth, are a kind-hearted race that loves to run. Since the legendary three goddesses created them millions of years ago, they have been relentlessly exploring this vast world, building a prosperous civilization of their own with their hard-working hands and wise brains.\n\nWith the further development of the Umamusume's technology and culture, the organization called Central Tresen Academy unified all the Umamusume on the planet for the first time and established the Umamusumes' Republic. For the first time in history, the Umamusume were able to fly out of their home system and reflect the vastness of the universe in their eyes.\n\nThe competition horn has been blown, this time, can the Umamusume again stand on that glorious winner's stage?"
