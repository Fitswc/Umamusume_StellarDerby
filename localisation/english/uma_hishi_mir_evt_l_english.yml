 uma_fz.2.title: "Ordinary Planet"
 uma_fz.2.desc: "Our research ship has discovered an ocean planet in the galaxy. At present, it seems that this planet is nothing special like most of the planets we have encountered so far, but the scientist in charge of the investigation said that he had a hunch that there seemed to be something strange on this planet."
 uma_fz.2.a: "Since the investigators have said so, let's send someone to conduct a detailed investigation."
 uma_fz.2.b: "Such an ordinary planet is not worth wasting our resources"
 uma_fz.3.title: "Twin Islands"
 uma_fz.3.desc: "After a month of investigation, our researchers observed from orbit that the only remaining land on this ocean planet is two small islands. The preliminary investigation report was quickly delivered to us, and the investigators are waiting for our next instructions."
 uma_fz.3.a: "Interesting, approved to enter orbit for investigation"
 uma_fz.3.b: "Just two islands, no need to investigate"
 uma_fz.4.title: "Discover"
 uma_fz.4.desc: "Our research ship entered the planet's surface, and soon they found from the images that there were traces of biological activity on the island. After a more detailed investigation, the researchers found a flying vehicle on the beach of one of the islands. When they turned the camera image to another island, they saw a pieced-together distress signal and a... Umamusume on the beach?"
 uma_fz.4.a: "Rescue the trapped persons immediately"
 uma_fz.5.title: "Saving Private Umamusume"
 uma_fz.5.desc: "Our people successfully rescued the Umamusume who was stranded on the island. The rescued girl quickly expressed her gratitude to us, but now a question puzzled everyone: what is the origin of this Umamusume? Why did she appear on this ocean planet?"
 uma_fz.5.a: "Call up the video and ask her what happened"
 uma_fz.5.b: "Let's put this matter aside for now."
 uma_fz.5.b.tt: "This Umamusume will return to [capital_scope.GetName]"
 uma_fz.6.desc: "Hello, I am Hishi Miracle, thank you for saving me, otherwise I would have stayed on this island forever (crying voice)"
 uma_fz.6.a: "Why did you come to this island?"
 uma_fz.7.desc: "This is a long story. Actually, my trainer arranged a month of endurance training for me. In order to avoid the training, I drove a flying vehicle to find this island and planned to escape the training."
 uma_fz.7.a: "But why are you trapped?"
 uma_fz.8.desc: "The island on this planet was actually originally one piece, but after I stopped the spacecraft, unloaded most of the supplies, and took a nap, the island suddenly split into two."
 uma_fz.8.a: "But the distance between the two islands is not far."
 uma_fz.8.a.tt: "For a Umamusume, swimming this distance is nothing."
 uma_fz.9.desc: "Hehe...\n(Hishi touched her head awkwardly and smiled, obviously she was avoiding the question you asked)"
 uma_fz.9.a: "In that case, would you like to join us?"
 uma_fz.10.desc: "What? Join you? Why? I'm just an ordinary Umamusume that can be found everywhere..."
 uma_fz.10.a: "It seems like you have a talent for flying a spaceship."
 uma_fz.10.a.tt: "After all, he must be very observant to be able to come here by himself in a flying vehicle."
 uma_fz.11.desc: "Well...can you give me some time to think about it? After all, I ran away secretly this time, so at least give me some time to prepare, and I also have to explain everything to the trainer."
 uma_fz.11.a: "Your trainer will help you explain, we really need you now."
 uma_fz.11.b: "Well, when you are ready, please come to us."
 uma_fz.13.title: "Miracle"
 uma_fz.13.desc: "Three years have passed, and the Umamusume named Hishi Miracle has not reported yet. Just when we thought we would never meet her again, we got a piece of news. In the latest G1 competition, a Umamusume who was not favored by people suddenly won the first place in this competition and defeated other opponents. Originally, this was not a rare thing, but when people learned that this Umamusume had a "good record" of nine consecutive losses in her previous debut competition, we had to look at this Umamusume who could be said to have created a miracle with new eyes."
 uma_fz.13.a: "Let us meet this miracle child"
  
 uma_fz.14.desc: "Um, hello, my name is Hishi Miracle... Hey, wait, have we met before?"
 uma_fz.14.a: "We saved you before on an ocean planet."
  
 uma_fz.15.desc: "Ah, I remember now. I seemed to have said that I would come back to prepare and then join you... Sorry, after I returned, I got lectured by the trainer and then I forgot about it."
 uma_fz.15.a: "没事，祝贺你取的了这么好的成绩"  <"Congratulations on your good grades."
 uma_fz.16.desc: "No, I didn’t expect that I could win the first place, even though there were so many strong opponents."
 uma_fz.16.a: "那么‘奇迹’小姐，你现在可以加入我们了吗？"  <"So Miss Miracle, can you join us now?"
 uma_fz.17.desc: "Eh? Really? I'm just an ordinary Umamusume. Can I really take on such an important job?"
 uma_fz.17.a: "We believe that you can create more miracles just like on the court."
 uma_fz.18.desc: "OK... OK, thank you, I will try my best, and please give me more advice in the future!"
 uma_fz.18.a: "Come on, we look forward to your future"
 uma_fz.19.title: "LAZY!"
 uma_fz.19.desc: "Hishi Miracle has joined us for several years, but unlike her repeated miracles in the arena, she has only been doing some ordinary exploration and research work in obscurity. Although this is not a big problem, this is the core research department of Traincent after all, and Hishi Miracle is also our hand-picked researcher. In the various departments of Traincent, which are already seriously involuntarily, this behavior that can even be said to be close to rottenness may not be a good thing."
 uma_fz.19.a: "Go remind her, at least I hope she can achieve some results."
 uma_fz.19.b: ""
 uma_fz.20.title: "Interlude"
 uma_fz.20.desc: "You found Hishi Miracle, but not in the research institute but in the lounge for researchers. When you found her, she was lying on the sofa, eating potato chips and reading a book, laughing. She didn't even notice your sudden arrival. \n"Hishi Miracle!" \nYour voice obviously scared her. The potato chips on her chest fell to the ground, and the book in her hand was thrown to your feet. You also saw the name of the book: \n"About My Reincarnation into a Different World as a Slender Umamusume" \n"I'm sorry, I shouldn't be lazy here..." Treasure quickly realized her mistake and immediately chose to admit her mistake."
 uma_fz.20.a: "Don't do it again"
 uma_fz.20.b: "Hishi Miracle, we regret to inform you..."
 uma_fz.21.title: "Assistant"
 uma_fz.21.desc: "Since she was found slacking off in the lounge last time, Hishi Miracle has obviously taken her work more seriously. But Hishi Miracle still has to make some significant contributions to prove herself. Our chief scientist [Root.science_leader.GetName] has obviously noticed this problem, so she suggested to us that we let someone she trusts assist Hishi Miracle."
 uma_fz.21.a: "This is indeed a good idea"
 uma_fz.21.b: "Let's keep the status quo."

 UMA_SURVEY_THE_OCEAN_PLANET_DESC: "Our research ship has discovered an ocean planet in the galaxy. It looks like nothing special about this planet, just like most of the planets we have encountered so far. However, the scientist in charge of the investigation said that he had a hunch that there seemed to be something strange about this planet. It seems worth a look."
 UMA_SAVE_THE_PIG_FROM_WATER: "[Root.GetName]Rescue"
 UMA_SAVE_THE_PIG_FROM_WATER_DESC: ""The researchers spotted a flying vehicle on the beach of one of the islands. When they turned the camera to the other island, they saw a patchwork distress signal and a Umamusume on the beach. Now it was time to fish her out."
