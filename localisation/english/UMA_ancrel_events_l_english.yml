 #前置事件 
 umaarc.1008.name: "The relics of the Three Goddesses standing quietly"
 umaarc.1008.desc: "When we focus our attention on the sea of stars, a group of intelligent scientists keen to hold on to the land beneath their feet are still planning a program of subterranean exploration of the archaeological relics site of the Three Goddesses that found on our planet on an unprecedented scale. \n\n From the legends of ancient times to the archaeological and sociological literature of the ages, this relic has always been relevant to the origins of our species. \n\nThere are already many scientists working on it, but they firmly believe that an underground archaeological operation, which requires years of planning, will take all the work in this field to a new level"
 umaarc.1008.a: "One day we'll get to the bottom of it."
 #发现事件 
 umaarc.1000.name: "Archaeological operations at the Three Goddesses ruins is ready"
 umaarc.1000.desc: "After several years of careful planning, the Umamusumes who on Traincent will write an important entry in the history books today.The relics project team on [Root.GetName] has set up an elite scientific research team and has prepped the underground relics for possible damage to the structures, and the nation is taking a great interest in this operation - the veil of the ancestors is about to be lifted."
 umaarc.1000.a: "I Hope they can bring some good news"
 #考古营地 
 threegodnessrelic_digsite: "Archaeological relics of Three Goddesses"
 threegodnessrelic_digsite_desc: "The largest known site of the Three Goddesses on [From.Planet.GetName] is divided into two parts, above and below ground, and most scientific work up now has been confined to the ground. Early surveys proved that the above-ground site was only the tip of the iceberg of the full extent of the site."
 #考古营地阶段1 
 umaarc.1001.name: "A piece of cake"
 umaarc.1001.desc: "The research team entered the intricate underground passageway from a more stable entrance according to a preplanned selection, and marched towards the selected destination - an area with a vast amount of documents and murals - while collecting various artifacts along the way."
 # Stage 2 
 umaarc.1002.name: "Group of statues"
 umaarc.1002.desc: "On the way to the destination, the team continued to find statues of various forms, including the well-known three goddesses, but also other creatures of various forms that look like the Umamusume, this is our ancestors, and it seems that the different groups of statues record many valuable prehistoric events. Further documentation will be carried out by the Relics Project team in the future."
 # Stage 3 
 umaarc.1003.name: "Everything is ready"
 umaarc.1003.desc: "Eventually, the scientific research team's destination was close at hand. The results of early surveys showed that the murals here contain important information about the ancestral origins of the Umamusume, but the research team has been slow to translate the murals and the documents recorded on them because there were not enough resources allocated to them in the pre-interstellar era. The research team will clean up the surrounding environment to ensure the work is carried out smoothly before the official analysis work."
 # Stage 4 
 umaarc.1004.name: "Parsing work"
 umaarc.1004.desc: "Accompanying the scientific research team, equipped with professional analysis equipment of the analysis team began their work at this time. At the same time, other members of the scientific research team also surveyed and analyzed other artifacts in the documentation area. According to the process, they will work at a fixed point in time to unify and organize the work. \n\nThis will be a long process, but the rewards are equally rewarding"
 # Stage 5 
 umaarc.1005.name: "Revelation of the Three Goddesses"
 #umaarc.1005.desc: "在漫长的整合工作收尾后，科考组现在可以骄傲地宣布——三女神遗迹的考古工作获得了圆满的成功。\n\n这些壁画中的文献的记录大致上可以概括为：我们的祖先是三女神播种而诞生的产物，并且三女神极有可能是真实存在的一种以我们目前的科技水平几乎完全无法理解的高纬度文明生物。她们为我们留下了一笔极为宝贵的遗产，地表上的壁画文献中记载的知识，与此处相比不过九牛一毛。如果我们能够完全理解并运用三女神馈赠的知识，对于已经跨入星海的我们大有裨益。"  <"After a long integration work, the scientific expedition team can now proudly announce that the archaeological work of the Three Goddesses Ruins has been a complete success. \n\nThe records in the documents in these murals can be roughly summarized as follows: Our ancestors are the products of the sowing of the Three Goddesses, and the Three Goddesses are very likely to be real high-dimensional civilized creatures that are almost completely incomprehensible with our current level of technology. They left us an extremely valuable legacy. The knowledge recorded in the murals and documents on the surface is just a drop in the bucket compared to this. If we can fully understand and use the knowledge given by the Three Goddesses, it will be of great benefit to us who have already stepped into the sea of ​​stars.">  #NT!
 umaarc.1005.desc: "After the long integration work wrapped up, the scientific research team can now proudly announce that the archaeological work of the Three Goddesses site has been a complete success.\n\nThe record of these murals can be roughly summarized as follows:our ancestors were the product of the seeds sown by the Three Goddesses, and the Three Goddesses were likely real beings of a high-latitude civilization that is almost completely incomprehensible to our current level of technology. They have left us an extremely valuable legacy, and the knowledge recorded in the mural literature on the surface is a drop in the bucket compared to what is found here. If we can fully understand and apply the knowledge gifted by the three goddesses, it will be of great benefit to us who have already crossed the sea of stars."
 umaarc.1004.tooltip: "In any case, the effect of the Three Goddesses' revelation to us is incalculable. Therefore, the establishment of a special research institute should be on the agenda as soon as possible. In addition, the research team strongly recommends that we should build a subterranean site complex, together with the above-ground site complex, as a complete museum for all the Umamusume of [From.Planet.GetName] to visit, and also to facilitate the subsequent scientific research work."
 #后续 
 umaarc.1006.name: "Construction of the Three Goddesses Museum completed"
 #umaarc.1006.desc: "在经历了一年多的建设后，一座巨大的博物馆在原来的三女神遗址群拔地而起，每天都会接待成千上万对先祖起源感到好奇的马娘们。三女神的启示使得全国上下更加坚定了再星海时代中前进的步伐。"  <"After more than a year of construction, a huge museum was built at the site of the original Three Goddesses, and every day it receives thousands of horse girls who are curious about the origins of their ancestors. The revelation of the Three Goddesses has made the whole country more determined to move forward in the Star Sea Era.">  #NT!
 umaarc.1006.desc: "After more than a year of construction, a huge museum rose in the Three Goddesses archaeological site, and every day it receives thousands of Umamusume who are curious about the origin of their ancestors. The revelation of the Three Goddesses has strengthened the nation's resolve to move forward in the age of the sea of stars again."
 umaarc.1006.a: "Eclipse First, The stars nowhere."
  
 ###速茶遗迹考古 
 tachyon_coffee_relic: "Abandoned Space Research station"
 tachyon_coffee_relic_desc: "We found a space station near the planet called Laika. It was old and worn out in terms of age, but the deck metal on its surface did not leave scratches from the battle, and it was still as smooth as new to the touch, and its hardness could still serve as armor against ship attacks. The space station just floats here, unattended, leaving only dust behind.\nAgnes Tachyon and Manhattan Cafe are prepared to drive the research ship close to it, and they speculate that the space station was once made by a group of craftsmen from an ancient civilization. They can follow the clues of the information left on the station to further dig out the whereabouts of this ancient civilization. Of course, the premise is that it still retains the information and is able to work."

 tachyon_coffee.2041.a: "Curious"
 tachyon_coffee.2041.desc: "Agnes Tachyon and Manhattan Cafe's spacecraft successfully approached the space research station, where they donned their equipment and boarded the station.\nDespite Agnes Tachyon's discontent with the co-recording officer who followed them, she simply said, \"As long as it doesn't interfere with my research.\" \nThe research station has completely stopped operating after a long time without energy support. Fortunately, Agnes Tachyon carries the energy to support the operation of the station for some time, and this time can also support them to crack the secrets of the place and then return to the ship."

 tachyon_coffee.2042.a: "We are so strong"
 tachyon_coffee.2042.desc: "With a \"Thump\" of the cabin, the bright light returned to the confined space.\nThere is no one in the cabin, perhaps something happened and fled the place, but some documents are still left in the research station, I do not know if they left in such a hurry and forgot to destroy, or destroy the documents is not in the plan. This is not known, but it certainly helps us to learn more about them.\nAfter checking that the equipment was working properly, Agnes Tachyon quickly cracked the computer while Manhattan Cafe tried to translate the language in the paper documents. They are familiar with this process, and it is expected that it will not take long to crack the contents of the document.\n And what does our records officer do? Look, she's planning to carry something useful from here back to our home planet!"

 tachyon_coffee.2043.name: "\“Content\”"
 tachyon_coffee.2043.a: "Romantic and elegant, utilitarian and pragmatic"
 tachyon_coffee.2043.desc: "As the contents of the document are deciphered, the secrets are opened to us horizontally like a scroll.\nThe builders of this research station come from a highly scholarly civilization. Their species is Fox, literally dedicated to the spread of knowledge. They have modesty as a virtue and rigor as a personality. They are silent not because they have nothing to say, but because they do not feel they have the knowledge to speak freely with a self-righteous attitude, so they are only listeners, and may ask some questions.\nThe title "citizen" has been replaced by \"student\" and they seem to think that life is lived as a student who is constantly learning.\nThey believed in the so-called "educationism" and read a lot of books on philosophy, literature, religion, history, etc. to cultivate their education. The higher the level of upbringing, the better they will be able to get ahead.\nAnd after that, they began to improve, no longer blindly reading books regardless of subject, but constantly refining them in many fields. Those who liked literature studied literature, those who liked physics studied physics, and those who liked engineering studied engineering. Now and then, a new discipline appears on the list of options available to all, and everyone can step into the unknown with their preferences.\n Everything seems to be thriving.\n"

 tachyon_coffee.2044.a: "A Fox Died, Another killed it"
 tachyon_coffee.2044.desc: "With social scientists have worked out a program, the days of being able to freely choose the direction of development are gone.\nThis program is called \"Tutor\" by social scientists, which seems to mean \"Guidance\". It can calculate and analyze the most suitable occupation and job for a person in his or her subsequent life, which may not be preferred by the screened person, but is the most suitable for him or her. It can even calculate a person's possible future criminal tendencies, to allow law enforcement officers to correct the education of personnel in advance. \n It is no longer driven by personal preference, but by what a person is best suited to do as an executive guide. The main target group for its screening is composed of students who are about to enter the field of elective science as adults.\nIt was made compulsory with a society-wide promotion, which provoked a backlash from a significant portion of the population, who insisted on defending their right to choose and Desperate struggle with the Collectivism.\nIn the end, the two armies faced each other and both were defeated. This once glorious civilization of the school state fell."

 tachyon_coffee_pre_civils_relic: "Ruins of Union College"
 tachyon_coffee_pre_civils_relic_desc: "Agnes Tachyon and Manhattan Cafe followed the resource clues they had previously found in the legacy space station and successfully discovered the planet once inhabited by this ancient civilization, which also seemed to be their planet's capital. This made them both excited for a long time, and it is said that they did not sleep much all day, and Tachyon also perversely drank coffee.\nIn short, everything is heading toward the truth, and our two brilliant scientists will lay out for us how an ancient interstellar civilization finally fell. On top of the remnants of their past, the present will learn new lessons for us in the near future. For our civilization to continue, it is only through the disastrous fall of the rest of civilizations as a history book, admonishing us to follow the true right way.\nNow they are ready to log in and everything is in order."

 tachyon_coffee.2071.desc: "They landed in the urban area of the planet, this urban area has suffered a cataclysmic catastrophe, in this land broken out a large internal war between you and me, the entire planet into a huge battlefield between the two sides, and this is only the land battlefield, we can not imagine in the vast galaxy they have carried out how brutal showdown.\nOnce perhaps prosperous central city has now become an uninhabitable ruin, bio-radar is not able to scan a trace of biological activity. But at least this way you no longer have to worry about unknown creatures attacking.\nAgnes Tachyon was a little discouraged, but she was confident that the results of her previous months would not lead her to a place where she had nothing.\n"It's okay, you see, we're just getting started now.\" Manhattan Cafe said soothingly from the sidelines.\" \nAs for our records officer is curious about the broken metal left behind by these extinct civilizations, and believes that these already destroyed pieces of architectural iron may be able to allow us to have a recycling path in some areas."

 tachyon_coffee.2072.name: "\“Library\”"
 tachyon_coffee.2072.a: "Look, we now have a bunch of books that we can't read"
 tachyon_coffee.2072.desc: "Three Umamusumes walked carefully and finally stopped in front of a huge circular building. The white exterior of the building had only a few scattered bullet marks, and the interior was intact, with only a lot of dust. Around the building, there were ruins from the shelling. What makes it so special? Even the war seems to have deliberately left it.\n They continued to walk inside, and after opening the wooden door, what they saw was a strictly classified and neatly arranged sandalwood bookshelf. The bookshelf displayed books that were subdivided into various fields. On both sides of the room were plastered heads of beautiful women with fox ears, some innocent, some flirtatious; under each head was a small introduction plate with gold lettering, which seemed to tell the history of their community, and these people might be some of the great people of their history.\nYes, this is a library, a place they hold sacred, and the reason why the war would stay away from here is explained.\nManhattan Cafe had learned their language earlier and now she was reading a book intently.\n \" Look ...... we are Umamusumes ...... they are Fox Girls ......\" Agnes Tachyon strolled in front of the plaster statue, looking down and reading the presentation sign on it, but she had no idea what the text meant. She then turned her head to Manhattan Cafe and said, "Cafe, what do you read? Tell me about it?"\n“Their independent history”\n“They were slaves?”\n“It looks like this, there is a section here, it is said that they used to get together secretly to read books, and after being discovered, they were flayed and hanged.”\n“So cruel ......”\nAgnes Tachyon listened for a while and was not interested in listening anymore, so she ran to the records officer and ask\n“I said Comrade Record Officer, are you interested in moving all these books to our planet?”\nThe records officer was impressed and sent a report to HQ for this request.\nThis request was quickly approved."

 tachyon_coffee.2073.name: "\“Statue\”"
 tachyon_coffee.2073.a: "Great people are not all immortal"
 tachyon_coffee.2073.desc: "These days Manhattan Cafe and the records officer were gathering information within the library, while Agnes Tachyon was out on her own looking for another place worth visiting. She quickly pinpointed a location, the planet's governor's mansion. This would be another target location for them.\n“They have to bring their books with them when they are at war so that they don't have to look on in despair when there is no war.”Manhattan Cafe continued flipping through the independent history it had taken out of the library earlier.\n“Nerds!”\n“But they fight very fiercely, their sharp teeth can bite off the neck of the enemy in an instant, and claws are said to be able to scratch the deck of the battleship.”Manhattan Cafe said with a smile.\n“The last one is a real exaggeration! I can also say that my foot can kick through the steel plate of the ship.”Agnes Tachyon pie her mouth, Go to the front of the room.\n“So it's 'allegedly', you're still making a comparing.”\nThree Umamusumes came out of the library and walked along the street, and soon came to a vacant lot, in the middle of which stood a bronze statue, which might have been a central square for people before the outbreak of war, but is not very visible now.\nThe bronze statue is about 40 meters high. The main body of the statue is a woman with fox ears and a tail, holding a flag in her left hand and a long sword in her right hand; the base of the statue is carved with lifelike giant reliefs and inscriptions on all sides.\n“Who is she?”Agnes Tachyon asked.\n“Fallensteel, the great national hero, the leader of the War of Independence, and the founder of civilization. This is the statue of the Fallensteel monument built to commemorate the victory of the War of Independence, and every expedition of their army must pass under the statue and sing the 'Victory Triumph' before setting off. The statue also symbolizes the humility, groundedness and resilience of their people.”Manhattan Cafe answered encyclopedically.\n“Just like our Three Goddesses”\n“But now she is all alone in the world”\n“And what is written on the inscription?”\n“'After us, the people will surely continue to the paths we have yet to explore and eventually pluck the stars.'" Manhattan Cafe slowly read the above words out."

 tachyon_coffee.2074.a: "Look like there is nothing here"
 tachyon_coffee.2074.desc: "“They can switch between animal and human forms so, do you think there is a possibility that some of the foxes in animal form on our planet are their surviving people? I think even if it is a civil war can not make the extinction of the genocide, right?”Manhattan Cafe's question arises suddenly.\n“Ah ...... means that they quietly gather the remnants of our planet and then set up a conspiracy against our government to prepare for the opportunity to seize power in our country?”Agnes Tachyon seems to have carefully analyzed and expressed her thoughts.\n“I didn't say that.”\n“Actually, it's not a bad idea to let them rule ...... I mean ...... stand for the Fallensteel faction!”Agnes Tachyon said this with a smile, as if it were a joking joke, but also as if it were a true statement.\nAs we chatted, the three Umamusumes had arrived at another destination of the trip, the Governor's Mansion of this planet.\nThe Governor's Mansion is two stories high and not very large in actual scope. The first floor is where the civilian staff of the Governor's Mansion works, while the second floor is the office.\nThere seems to have been a fierce battle inside the Governor's Mansion, the walls and doors are littered with bullet marks from gunshots and walls shattered by blasts. Fortunately, the governor's office did not suffer serious damage, but some important documents may have been destroyed because of the battle, for which we can do nothing.\nThe size of the governor's office is calculated by Umamusumes as 20 stacks, or about 32 square meters in size, which is considered the standard for individual solitary living. The interior is not furnished with luxuries, and a portrait of Fallensteel hangs on the wall behind the table. Under her attention, perhaps every governor has practiced benevolence.\n“Much more rustic than where we are ......”Agnes Tachyon looked around and seemed to feel something.\nThe records officer went forward to sort out the documents that remained undamaged and sent them to Manhattan Cafe, translating and recording their contents together with Manhattan Cafe. Agnes Tachyon was not used to this kind of thing, so she was free to move around the Governor's Mansion. She treated the governor's mansion like a child as a treasure spot on a treasure map, thinking that she would always find something extra here.\nBut soon after she came back to the Governor's office disappointed."

 tachyon_coffee.2075.a: "Looks like we got lucky."
 tachyon_coffee.2075.desc: "With the complete deciphering of the documents stored in the Governor's Office, we discovered the research process of the " Tutor " program. This is a project that was ordered by the supreme leader and carried out by a group of researchers. In fact, in order to continue the project, the leader put a lot of effort to calm her people and made many promises, but after the completion of the project, these words seemed to become scrap paper. The rest is the result of what we saw earlier at the space research station. Finally, we were pointed to the institute where the program was first studied. Let's take our chances and see if it's still there.\n"If we let them continue to develop, I wouldn't be surprised if an electric screen that can spy on people at any time appears." Agnes Tachyon leaned against Manhattan Cafe's shoulder while her eyes narrowed and stared at the translated document in her hand.\n“You went to read Miss Blair's book?”\n“Because I want to change my job to a sociologist!”\nWithout further rest, the three Umamusumes packed up their papers and left from the Governor's residence, heading for the Institute.\nThis institute seems to have been built with concealment in mind when it was first built, and it took them several laps outside before they "accidentally" discovered this underground facility.\nThe Institute was placed underground, where the electrical equipment was still working, perhaps because of the warning of the danger. The three Umamusumes then walked up the elevator and stepped into the unknown depths of the underground.\n When the elevator door slowly opened, reflected in their eyes is a giant display screen, in the bottom is used to operate the console.\n"The place has been functioning all this time, even though not a single person was there. It seems the government did a good job of concealing it, and the uprising masses failed to find it and destroy it." Agnes Tachyon said with some pity.\nThe three Umamusumes arrived at their final destination, and now it's time to recover."
