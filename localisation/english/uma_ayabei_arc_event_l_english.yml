 uma_ss_arc.2.title: "Fake Star?"
 uma_ss_arc.2.desc: "After visiting the Three Goddesses Museum, a recent Traincent graduate claimed on the Internet that an ancient civilization mural in the museum depicted a real starry sky, even saying it was wrong and marking what she believed to be the wrong stars - three roughly equal distances in the middle of the mural.\nAlthough archaeologists have speculated similarly, we cannot compare the dozen or so stars drawn by the ancients to known visible stars."
 uma_ss_arc.2.a: " Wild fantasy. Let her go"
 uma_ss_arc.2.b: "Interesting,What is her name"
 uma_ss_arc.2.a_END: "This will end this events chain."
  
  
 uma_ss_arc.3.title: "BrillianceⅠ"
 uma_ss_arc.3.desc: "We had a preliminary communication with her on the Internet. Her name is "Admire Vega", she is an astronomy enthusiast and history enthusiast, and she is well-known in the circle of astronomy enthusiasts.\nShe labeled what she thought were the names of all the stars in the mural, but without any scientific evidence, just by feeling; That said, she had a deep knowledge of astronomy, judging by the terminology she used and her knowledge of the stars."

 uma_ss_arc.3.a.b: "Ask her if she'd like to be an assistant in the astronomy department?"
 uma_ss_arc.3.b: "Well, I guess we all have good science literacy."
 uma_ss_arc.4.title: "BrillianceⅡ"
 uma_ss_arc.4.desc: "The astronomy department sent a report. "Admire Vega", who joined the department a year ago, showed her unparalleled scientific talent after systematic training, especially in astronomy and archaeology. Now the veteran scientists in the astronomy Department are competing with each other in order to admire her as their assistant.\nHowever, we consulted my wishes, and she would prefer to board a research ship to be close to the stars she loves."
 uma_ss_arc.4.a: "It's danger to explore the unknown universe, She should stay in the academy"
 uma_ss_arc.4.b: "Let we satisfy her little wish"
  
 uma_ss_arc.7.title: "Report"
 uma_ss_arc.7.desc: "Admire Vega has always been a leader in space exploration. In this year's presentation, she refined the star map and put forward several valuable guesses and evidence for current issues.\nIn addition, she has been concerned about the new progress of the star murals in the Three Goddesses Museum research, and asked for a report on this."
 uma_ss_arc.8.desc: "Good evening, everybody, according to [This.GetHomeWorldName]."
 uma_ss_arc.8.a: "Good evening, Admire Vega。"
 uma_ss_arc.9.desc: "This years, I have observed the stars on different planets, and compared the star maps, I am more sure that the star murals of the three goddesses depict the real sky at that time."
 uma_ss_arc.9.a: "If you put it that way, you must have some kind of proof?"
 uma_ss_arc.10.desc: "Yes, I could find no evidence for that, but then I thought that if I could find star maps from other civilizations of the time and compare them, we could be sure. Fortunately, I was able to find a star map that had been recorded by a certain civilization for tens of thousands of years."
 uma_ss_arc.10.a: "The Conclusion is?"
 uma_ss_arc.11.desc: "My guess is almost certainly correct, the data has been uploaded to the terminal for further confirmation, and the three stars do not exist."
 uma_ss_arc.11.a: "What do you think this means"
 uma_ss_arc.12.desc: "Rationally, this is more likely to be an astronomical phenomenon that once existed in this galaxy; But I have a feeling they may not be natural."
 uma_ss_arc.12.a: "Yes?"
 uma_ss_arc.13.desc: "I think that all the locations of the mural depicting these three stars should be marked, and if there is a clear regional area, then it is necessary to investigate around these locations, and for convenience I propose to call it the triangular Star."
 uma_ss_arc.13.a: "We will survey it, And what about going back to do research?"
 uma_ss_arc.14.desc: "Ah, about this, something happened to me when I was a child, and I felt a strong sense of belonging from the stars in the sky, as if I could talk to those stars. At that time, I thought that if I could chase my favorite stars in the exploration of the universe in the future, it would be the realization of my long-standing wish"
 uma_ss_arc.14.a: "Okay, We respect your choice"
 uma_ss_arc.14.b: "Science is cutting edge too, huh?"
 uma_ss_arc.14.resp.a: "I will continue to lead you in the first place to explore the sea of stars."
 uma_ss_arc.14.resp.b: "If the country really needs it, I will do my part."

 UMA_SILENT_SUZUKA_TRANGLE_STAR: "Stargaze"
 UMA_SILENT_SUZUKA_TRANGLE_STAR_DESC: "According to Admire Vega, we had to mark all the relics of ancient civilizations that had painted the star in the frescoes, identify key areas, and search the area for anything that might have been missed.\nIt required a lot of resources, and at first most of the researchers objected, but as soon as they heard that Admire Vega had put forward the proposal, the objections all died down, and now the archaeologists are ready to admire the mysteries of the starry sky."
  
  
 uma_ss_arc.16.title: "Under the gaze of the stars"
 uma_ss_arc.16.desc: "As Admire Vega suspected, the triangulation was confined to a small area, and although the original archaeological detectors did not detect any anomalies in the area, the military detectors deployed reported faint anomalies.\nThe engineering team dug a pit hundreds of meters deep in the anomalous area, and then encountered strong interference to paralyze the site, it is clear that this is not only the remains of an ancient civilization, but a pioneer with advanced technology.\nWhat does this have to do with the mysterious triangular star? And how is it helpful to explore the origins of our Umamusume? It's all waiting for the archaeologists..."
 uma_ss_arc.16.a: "Forward!!"
  
 ss_arc_relic_desc: "The ruins of a highly developed ancient civilization sleep beneath the land we live in. Where did it come from? Any connection to our ancestors? even Is there anything alive in there? The archaeologists are ready to go, eager to uncover a piece of the truth...\nNow let's get started."
  
 uma_ss_arc.2071.desc: "In front of the archaeologists is an extremely advanced communication jamming device, which interferes with the detection of ordinary detectors, and all the electronic or photonic communicators invested in it are lost, and we must find a way to establish a stable communication.\n\nUsing Crystal carrot's communication channel is a worthwhile approach."
 uma_ss_arc.2071.title: "Jammer"
 uma_ss_arc.2071.a: "Looks like we're gonna have to get expensive"
 uma_ss_arc.2072.desc: "The communication channel with Crystal carrot is extremely stable, far beyond the scientists' expectations, as if it were a jammer set up specifically for Crystal carrot to communicate.\n\nAs soon as we actually set foot on the site, our team of archeologists reported an important fact to the headquarters: the area was covered by Realms and we had to explore with serious interference.

 uma_ss_arc.2072.title: "Just like the mire"
 uma_ss_arc.2072.a: "Ok"
 uma_ss_arc.2073.desc: "Strange Password"
 uma_ss_arc.2073.title: "After navigating the realms of illusion, strange tentacled creatures, and dangerous disorder, the archaeologists finally found the entrance to the entire ruins under the protection of their own Realm, which was blocked by a very ordinary looking gate controlled by a set of combination locks. But this code is unlike any that has been encountered in many relics of the past, and it has puzzled our deciphers.\n\nAfter discussion, the team will continue the code-breaking work, and the rest of the team will continue to explore the main body of the building."
 uma_ss_arc.2073.a: "Continue"
 uma_ss_arc.2074.desc: "The code was eventually cracked by sociologists in Central Traincent, a special set of codes based on the Umamusume factor, an uncomplicated encoding that effectively prevents confidential information from leaking to non-umamusume civilizations. The team will finally have access to this mysterious relic hidden beneath our home planet.\n\nThere is no clutter in the building, only one floor, four corners of each place is still in operation of an unknown large equipment, like an exhibition. All four devices are connected to the main processor in the middle.\n\nWith the danger out of the way, all that remains is to figure out what the data and devices are."

 UMA_SILENT_SUZUKA_ANA_CODE_DESC: "Archaeological work on the site stopped abruptly, and the rest of the work became translating texts and technical analysis, with one archaeologist complaining that "There is no archaeological feeling at all, it is as boring as a test".\n\nMany scientists believe that this relic is likely a test left by the ancient Umamusume civilization for its descendants, as both the Realm mire and the factor code can only be solved by the Umamusume civilization.\n\nConjecture is conjecture after all, and all the truth must wait until the translation is completed."

 uma_ss_arc.18.title: "Translate Completed"
 uma_ss_arc.18.desc: "We successfully translated the text from the processor, and in addition to the data about the four devices, the most notable is an obtrusive log:\n§gDetection signal of S103e-E023258-SS civilization detected§!\n§gAgreement V applies, confidentiality level C applies§!\n§gThe Galaxy is also my home, and I don't want to let "those guys" make trouble, not to mention the fact that the level of security is obviously too high, and I will leave some information in violation of the law, such a corner will not care...§!\nThis appears to be the legacy of a pioneer who once lived on the planet, but despite the mystery, described a civilization with an extremely long serial number and seemed to be on some mission that required evacuation after encountering the civilization's detection signal.\nIt can be inferred that both the pioneer and the civilization described by the number are developed civilizations that have achieved galaxy group navigation, and the number civilization seems to be a threat to the galaxy, but we can still summarize some content from the limited text.\nThere's a coordinate left at the end of the log, and it looks like we need to get to the bottom of it."
 uma_ss_arc.18.a: "Big Progress"
  
 uma_ss_arc.19.title: "Analyse Completed"
 uma_ss_arc.19.desc: "The analysis of four large devices has been preliminarily completed, and it can be determined that these devices do not use too advanced technology, but better apply theory to practice, and scientists are stepping up the reverse engineering of these technologies."

 uma_ss_arc.20.title: "Possible's future"
 uma_ss_arc.20.desc: "Our scientists have successfully developed a "talent meter" that can estimate the talent of Umamusume. This instrument can help Umamusume to plan their own development path and greatly improve the efficiency of national operation. But obviously, this instrument has serious social ethical problems and we must be cautious in its application."
 uma_ss_arc.20.a: "Umamusume should have the freedom to choose whether or not to use it."

 uma_ss_arc.21.title: "An official call to arms"
 uma_ss_arc.21.desc_a: " "I deeply regret the decision of Traincent Central to put the so-called "Talent instrument" into use. "\n[This.GetRulerTitle][This.GetRulerName]It can be seen that the State has discussed the social implications of this matter.
