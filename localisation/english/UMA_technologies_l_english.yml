 tech_uma_eco_friendly_farming: "Eco-Agriculture Thinking"
 tech_uma_eco_friendly_farming_desc: "Since ancient times, we have believed that developing agriculture and protecting ecology is a zero-sum game - agricultural development must come at the cost of ecological damage. However, as we advance in technology, it's time to throw this view into the trash heap. As we turn nature into farmland, we will also return farmland to nature."

What are the conditions for its creation? Does every Umamusume have a domain?\n In order to find out the truth about the 'Realm', scientists have carried out a lot of data collection work and tried to find patterns."
