 uma_preftl.2.title: "Flash flood!"
 uma_preftl.2.desc: ""Our observatory reports show that an unprecedentedly strong tropical storm on [event_target:uma_pre_ftl_planet] is moving towards the settlements of these indigenous Umamusumes; from the geological analysis, this will trigger a super-large-scale flash flood! The technology of our indigenous counterparts is too primitive, and they know nothing about this disaster. Our scientists believe that this will be the largest impact that the civilization on [event_target:uma_pre_ftl_planet] has experienced."

 uma_preftl.3.title: "The End of an Era"
 uma_preftl.3.desc: "The typhoon caused severe floods and landslides, which caused a large number of casualties among the villagers and buried the farmland on which the Umamusumes depended for survival. Most of them had to choose to migrate. \nLed by a local named Sadaya and her descendants, a large number of Umamusumes migrated to §Y亚斯特拉海峡§!, merging with local small settlements to form a large settlement across the strait. This was the first settlement of the Umamusumes that could be called civilized, "Yasta", and the center of the entire "Theshimo Culture". \nDuring the migration process, due to food shortages, all food was uniformly distributed by the patriarch, forming a fairly authoritative §Y统治阶级§!; the Umamusumes began to think about the belief in all things in nature, developed a reverence for the natural environment, and developed a trend of ancestor worship."

 uma_preftl.4.title: "Stop!"
 uma_preftl.4.desc: "To stop this strong typhoon, we need to emit energy beams externally to generate a huge amount of heat to produce an anticyclone opposite to the typhoon cyclone to offset the kinetic energy of the typhoon. The brightness of the beams is hard to be ignored by the natives. However, they were surprised to find that after a few seconds of strong light, the strong wind suddenly disappeared. An indigenous horse girl named Sadaya described it as "the help of the three goddesses." After this legendary experience, the Umamusumes began to think about the belief in all things in nature, began to have awe of the natural environment, and began to wonder what secrets there were above the starry sky in front of them."

 uma_preftl.9997.desc: "§gEach Umamusume is a unique star in this universe. When the ship that can travel in the sea of stars set sail, do you remember the past of the stars?\n§!This is a small introduction written by a scientist with literary temperament on the first report sent by the observation station on [FromFrom.GetName]. \nAccording to the first report sent back, the civilization on [FromFrom.GetName] is the same species as ours: Umamusumes. According to our observation: they expand and reclaim wasteland, develop rugged mountains, and trade with other villages. Under the condition of food shortage, Umamusumes who can produce more food are often respected; because they often need to fight against the natural environment and natural disasters, and each horse girl needs a considerable amount of land to ensure survival, the clan system gradually emerged here. In addition, there are very few armed conflicts between tribes for resources. If conflicts arise, they are often resolved by a race duel."  #NT!

 uma_preftl.6.title: "Race and War"
 uma_preftl.6.desc: "The technological development of the Bronze Age of the Umamusume focused on the improvement of agricultural technology. The Umamusumes greatly improved the level of agricultural production through the accumulation of experience, and the population began to grow rapidly in this era. \n Because of the problem of food and land, they inevitably had a lot of disputes with other tribes, most of which were resolved by the clans sending several Umamusumes to compete in races. \n With the improvement of agricultural level, Umamusumes who specialized in running competitions began to appear. They usually came from farmland and represented the clan to run away, so they could get more land and food. As this system gradually became widely used, the intensity of the race also increased further. \n However, one day: the leader of a tribe with an invincible horse girl was killed in public by the soldiers of another tribe because of the problem of food distribution after the race, and all the food in their tribe was taken away, destroying the tribe. \n Later, they began to use force to expand."

 uma_preftl.8.title: "A Plague Tale"
 uma_preftl.8.desc: "A strange disease appeared on [From.GetName]. It first appeared in the western frontier area and later swept through a country called §YGuruxi Empire§! on the planet. \nThe symptoms of this disease are peculiar: at first, they will feel weak all over, and their physical strength and strength are not as good as before; then, they will start to suffer from insomnia and loss of appetite; then they will have hallucinations, show aggression or other mental symptoms, and these symptoms are varied. Some Umamusumes may have a high appetite and eat until their stomachs rupture; some will have no appetite until they die; the neighbors who greeted each other yesterday may stab you with pitchforks in two days. For a time, people were panicked, but the Umamusumes with huge appetites had to leave their homes, which made the plague difficult to control. Priests and doctors tried their best but could not resist this terrible plague. More people were infected, went crazy and died soon after. \nThe explanation given by the local church is also quite unbelievable to us: the reed-haired Umamusumes are cursed by the three goddesses. For a time, the Umamusumes of §YGuruxi Empire§! began to persecute the Umamusumes of Grey frantically: these innocent Umamusumes of Grey were labeled as "traitors" and "greedy people". The church initially required sufficient evidence for the trial, but soon the testimony process became a mess. Some even strangled the victims' thighs with ropes and hung them up until their legs were ischemic and necrotic, calling it "depriving them of the right to run"

 uma_preftl.10.desc: "The plague on [event_target:uma_pre_ftl_planet] gradually subsided. None of the Umamusumes had expected this sudden good thing. After a brief surprise, the local nobles began to organize the burning of corpses and conduct inspections from house to house. The local church described this as a blessing from the three goddesses, and they believed that this was the result of their continuous "deprivation of the curse of the three goddesses". This caused the persecuted Umamusumes to begin to flee to another country on this planet on a large scale."

After a brief surprise, the local nobles began to organize the burning of corpses and conduct inspections from house to house; before evacuating, our experts also used their prestige among the nobles to help the Lu Mao Umamusumes restore their due rights. \nHowever, the local natives seemed to have witnessed our evacuation spacecraft take off intentionally or unintentionally, which increased their speculation about things outside the starry sky."
 uma_preftl.12.title: "Great Plagues and Natural Selection"
 uma_preftl.12.desc: "Under the treatment of a local legendary doctor named §Y格涅斯§! in a secret hospital, the plague raging on [event_target:uma_pre_ftl_planet] gradually subsided. The local people began to carry out post-disaster and reconstruction work, and the legendary doctor disappeared afterwards. Soon, the local residents found that the church was helpless in the face of such a great disaster, so they began to oppose the church in secret, and the royal family used this plague as the last straw to break the camel's back of the church's control and consolidated its prestige among the people. \n Soon, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Pasar signed by the church and the royal family, the church completely lost control of the country. \n It seems that our indigenous friends have taken a big step forward in social change"

 uma_preftl.15.title: "The Voyage of the Umamusume"
 uma_preftl.15.desc: "For a long time, ocean voyages were troublesome for Umamusumes. The primary problem was supplies. Horse girls, who consumed a lot of food, often needed to carry a lot of food, which would slow down the ship. Therefore, ocean-going ships must be as lean as possible and have a certain degree of self-sufficiency. Those who dared to open up new ocean routes were all warriors at sea. Therefore, the first batch of navigators spent several years on trial voyages, recording wind direction and ocean currents, constantly fishing with fishing nets during the official voyage, and going ashore to collect supplies whenever they came across an island, and finally completed this great voyage. \nAs the great voyages intensified, many Umamusumes began to immigrate to the New World, ocean trade flourished, and the land annexation problem that had plagued countries for many years was alleviated. \nThis was the first time that the Umamusumes stepped out of the fields, so where would they go next?"
