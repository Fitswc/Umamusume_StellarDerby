 UMA_SILENT_SUZUKA_WAS_FOUND: "Prepare for planet scan"
 UMA_SILENT_SUZUKA_WAS_FOUND_DESC: "Our Orbiting Planet Explorer picked up a flash of a fast-moving object during a routine random scan of the planet, and even though the object was only there for a few seconds, our computer picked it up, and although this low-resolution image, which is similar to the ancient image, doesn't show much, But our scientists were able to identify it as a living creature by its shape, and while living things are quite normal on such a comfortable planet, something that can move at such high speeds seems unlikely given the local climate."
  
 uma_suzuka_anolomy: "Terrestrial meteor"
 uma_suzuka_anolomy_desc: "Our orbiting Planet Explorer was doing a routine random scan of the planet [From.Planet.GetName] when it spotted a flash of a fast-moving object, and even though it only appeared for a few seconds, our computer picked it up, Although there is little to show in this low-resolution image of similar ancient quality, our scientists were able to identify it as a living creature by its body shape, and although it is normal for life to exist on such a comfortable planet, it seems unlikely that such creatures can move at such high speeds, given the local climate conditions."

 uma_suzuka.2.desc: "Our orbiting Planet Explorer was doing a routine random scan of the planet [This.Getname] when it spotted a flash of a fast-moving object. Even though the object only appeared for a few seconds, our computer picked it up, and although This low-resolution image of similar ancient quality is basically invisible, But our scientists were able to identify it as a living creature by its shape, and while living things are quite normal on such a comfortable planet, something that can move at such high speeds seems unlikely given the local climate."
 uma_suzuka.2.a: "I felt it necessary to investigate"
 uma_suzuka.2.b: "I believe evolution will explain this phenomenon"
  
 uma_suzuka.3.title: "Now we just have to choose our options..."
 uma_suzuka.3.desc: "We intend to do a scan of the planet, but finding an object on a huge planet is not an ordinary difficulty, our scientists have provided two scanning options, and now we just need to make some small decisions."
 uma_suzuka.3.a: "Global face scan"
 uma_suzuka.3.b: "Random sampling scan"
 uma_suzuka.3.c: "That seems a little expensive"
  
 uma_suzuka.4.title: "Global Scan"
 uma_suzuka.4.desc: "After more than 300 days of global scanning, we finally found this flash again in a scan, but this time, it is like a race with our scanning light, you chase me; Our scientists, on the boat, watched this wonderful race with great interest, immersed in the graceful running posture of this creature; It was only when they found that the target they were tracking had suddenly stopped that they began to prepare for the airdrop for the field study."
 uma_suzuka.4.a: "What species has such speed?"
 uma_suzuka.5.title: "Sampling Scan"
 uma_suzuka.5.desc: "Through our sampling survey, which is like a crab digging a hole, we have not obtained much except for some local organisms that we have not seen before; But at the last inspection, we detected a slight anomaly on a prairie, and now our scientists are preparing to airdrop it for a field trip."
 uma_suzuka.5.a: "What species has such speed?"
 uma_suzuka.20.title: "So What we found?"
 uma_suzuka.20.desc: "After more than 30 days of random sampling, we all found entities with corresponding characteristics, it is possible that it has found our whereabouts, or it is possible that we are not so lucky..."

 uma_suzuka.6.title: "The colorful scenery"
 uma_suzuka.6.desc: "Accompanied by the accompanying security, our scientists landed on this planet, in the process of going to the marked location, our scientists have been marveling at this beautiful scenery, although it is a prairie, but under the background of different vegetation, it has a colorful color."
 uma_suzuka.6.a: "It must be nice to run here."
  
 uma_suzuka.8.title: "Oh, it's a lovely Umamusume"
 uma_suzuka.8.desc: "It may be that this dreamlike scene is so rare that our team took a little longer than expected to reach the target location; As the scientists approached the target point, escorted by security guards with guns raised, our scientists saw a Umamusume lying leisurely on the ground, seemingly asleep. In the breeze, she looks very lovely. Should we disturb her?"
 uma_suzuka.8.a: "Ask her"
 uma_suzuka.8.b: "Better not disturb her"
  
 uma_suzuka.9.title: "Oh, it's a wounded Umamusume"
 uma_suzuka.9.desc: "It may be that this dreamlike scene is so rare that our team took a little longer than expected to reach the target location; As the scientists approached the target point, escorted by security guards with guns raised, our scientists saw a Umamusume lying on her side on the ground with her hands around her legs in pain, seemingly unconscious from the pain."
 uma_suzuka.9.a: "Bring her back so the doctor can look at her"
 uma_suzuka.9.b: "It's not our business"
  
 uma_suzuka.10.title: "Heal!"
 uma_suzuka.10.desc: "After the doctor's diagnosis and treatment, Umamusume's fracture has been completely cured, but because of this fracture, running should be a bit of a step for her."
 uma_suzuka.10.a: "What a shame. Ah, she should be awake"
  
 uma_suzuka.11.title: "Death"
 uma_suzuka.11.desc: "Three years later, when our detector scanned [This.Planet.GetName] again, it found that the Umamusume we had left behind had become a white bone; The beautiful scenery is still there, but the horses that ran in it are gone; We are born in the land, and eventually return to the land, perhaps, this is the best outcome."
  
 uma_suzuka.12.title: "Let's keep running"
 uma_suzuka.12.desc: "We didn't bother her, just gently put a new pair of running shoes beside her and left. Since then, in all our tests, the Umamusume has appeared in our field of vision, and the scenery around her perfectly sets off her beautiful figure; Look, she is waving at us!"
 uma_suzuka.12.a: "Looks like we made the right choice"

 uma_suzuka.43.title: "Silent Star"
 uma_suzuka.43.desc: "We refused Silent Suzuka's request, but as compensation, we allowed her to run with the students during training. Now, we can often see Silent Suzuka running on the track with students. Although she can't reach the previous speed, it is enough for her to see the scenery ahead"

 uma_suzuka.44.title: "Broken Star"
 uma_suzuka.44.desc: "By straining herself too hard, Silent Suzuka broke her bones again, and the bones in her legs became very weak due to multiple fractures.\nIn order to prevent her from happening again, the doctor gave her a fixed device, although she can run again, but the speed is certainly not as fast as before; From then on, Silent Suzuka could often be seen sitting on a bench next to the track after school, touching his leg while looking at the students left to train on their own.\nSometimes she would run a lap by herself and finally leave with a sigh, looking at the stopwatch in her hand. Although she always smiled when talking with us, the bitterness and pain of not running behind her could not be covered up."
