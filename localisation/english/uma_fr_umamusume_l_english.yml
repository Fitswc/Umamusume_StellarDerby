 uma_fr_uma.2.title: "C·O·N·T·A·C·T"
 uma_fr_uma.2.desc: "[GetGlxName]'s report was sent out to the Student Council requesting to contact the Home Fleet in her home town. Although the contact rules have not been updated for millions of years, her message will certainly not go unnoticed.\nHowever, this kind of intergalactic communication may cause us unnecessary trouble, whether to agree to her request needs to be further discussed."
 uma_fr_uma.2.a: "Nope"
 uma_fr_uma.2.b: "No big deal, approved"
 uma_fr_uma.3.title: "Check"
 uma_fr_uma.3.desc: "A large group of executors seemed to misunderstand the order and broke into [GetGlxName]'s bedroom. [GetGlxName] made a fuss about the sudden inspection and tried to dissuade the executive, but was dismissed.\nOur guys checked the entire house, and there was nothing out of the ordinary in the house other than the same blond virtual Umamusume filled with various perimeters in various places."
 uma_fr_uma.3.a: "Oh, my God. What are you doing? "
  
 uma_fr_uma.4.desc: "......"
 uma_fr_uma.4.a: "I'm so sorry..."
  
 uma_fr_uma.5.desc: "Stop, stop, stop. I already know what's going on, I just didn't think it would happen to me. Uh, you know what, I'll send you these..."
 uma_fr_uma.5.a: "What?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.6.desc: "Some novels, cartoons, animations, movie episodes, three-dimensional illustrations and so on, let the horse women who disturb my sleep go back to carefully study, write three or four thousand words to send me, as punishment."
 uma_fr_uma.6.a: "Uh, well, let's get them to reflect. But what exactly are these?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.7.desc: "Let's do some of the old Tisput stuff."
 uma_fr_uma.7.a: "I see. I apologize again."
 uma_fr_uma.7.desc.respo: "No, no, young is good, I go back to catch up on sleep..."
  
 uma_fr_uma.8.title: "Descend from heaven"
 uma_fr_uma.8.desc: "Before the chastised foolhardy women could give their opinions, they started asking for more related works, citing "need more content for reference", which fortunately seems to be in stock at [GetGlxName].\nIn addition, it seems that some people spread these works out, and soon caused a small wave, in addition to the detailed description of the work itself, the virtual Umamusume image created by non-Umamusume civilization is also quite a bonus.\nSoon, enthusiasts began to create a second creation of the image, even overshadowed the original popularity of the virtual horsegirl, and as for the punishment of the feelings are collected, [GetGlxName] seems to be happy with them."
 uma_fr_uma.8.a: "Oh, well... What's her name?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.9.title: "Ghost Ship"
 uma_fr_uma.9.desc: "A small boat appeared without warning in [This.capital_scope.GetName], our probe did not respond at all, or the crew saw it as it approached the station at a very close distance.\nWe initially thought it might be some kind of unseen astronomical anomaly, but as more and more sightings came in, including sightings of the ship casually  in the atmosphere without provoking a response from the probe, scientists couldn't sit still."
  
 uma_fr_uma.10.title: "Visit with care"
 uma_fr_uma.10.desc: "Surprisingly, our special forces were able to board the ship with ease - its berthing guidance system was not even certified, and the ships of the boarding forces entered through their own berthing entrance.\nAccording to research, the ship's entire body is made of unknown alloys, circulating a complex energy field that can even correct gravitational waves, which is why it seems to our detectors that it does not exist. Optical stealth is also easy for it, but for some reason it is not turned on. The team members aboard the ship complained to us: although the interior decoration is like a luxury villa, but it is too messy here, all kinds of clothes and daily necessities are thrown on the ground, tables and chairs, chandeliers, drink cans scattered next to the trash can, probably shot on the sofa did not throw into; The half steak left on the table smelled strange, and the self-cleaning equipment in the cabin looked like it had been kicked and left in a corner; What makes people even more angry is that even the computer desktop and the ship database are in a mess, wondering how the owner of the ship is living."
 uma_fr_uma.10.a: "Wow..."
  
 uma_fr_uma.11.title: "Where?"
 uma_fr_uma.11.desc: "The ship does not even have the identity of the main control room, we have reason to suspect that it is a gift from the three goddesses, while entering the main control room, the team also began to tidy up the cabin, but something strange happened, when our team tried to activate it, suddenly everyone appeared in the universe - §K the ship disappeared §! And our detectors still haven't detected space fluctuations and gravitational fluctuations. Thanks to the suit's temporary space suit function, we were able to retrieve the crew members scattered across the universe."
 uma_fr_uma.11.a: "Where did it go?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.12.desc: "President, Good morning"
 uma_fr_uma.12.a: "[GetGlxName]? What's up?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.13.desc: "I heard there was a mysterious spaceship some time ago?"
 uma_fr_uma.13.a: "That's what's going on. Do you have any idea?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.14.desc: "Uh, is it still here?"
 uma_fr_uma.14.a: "Gone."
 uma_fr_uma_14.a.resp: "Oh, well, I was gonna check it out, but that's it."
  
 uma_fr_uma.15.title: "Odd"
 uma_fr_uma.15.desc: "[GetGlxName] showed concern about the whereabouts of the ship, but did not seem interested in it, which seemed out of her style, a little odd."
 uma_fr_uma.15.a: "Go spy on her! Remember, spy!"
  
 uma_fr_uma.16.title: "Purchase......"
 uma_fr_uma.16.desc: "[GetGlxName] The frequency and volume of purchases seems to have increased a lot lately, and the data shows that the items she buys are quite different these days."
 uma_fr_uma.16.a: "Hm hm."
  
 uma_fr_uma.17.title: "Trash......"
 uma_fr_uma.17.desc: "[GetGlxName] has been producing a lot more garbage lately, and although she herself is a take-away type, isn't two big bags a day a little too much?"
 uma_fr_uma.17.a: "Oh......"
  
 uma_fr_uma.18.title: "Sleep......"
 uma_fr_uma.18.desc: "[GetGlxName] Sleep time recently dropped from 16 hours to 8 hours, every day under the dark circles, a tired look."
 uma_fr_uma.18.a: "Hm hm."
  
 uma_fr_uma.19.title: "Attack!"
 uma_fr_uma.19.desc: "All the signs are that [GetGlxName] must be hiding something!"
 uma_fr_uma.19.a: "You have to hit hard!"
  
 uma_fr_uma.20.title: "“Full body Model”"
 uma_fr_uma.20.desc: "A large group of execs did not mishear their orders and broke into [GetGlxName]'s bedroom. [GetGlxName] again flummoxed by the unexpected inspection, and, despite trying to resist the executive, was once again removed. \nOur guys went through the house, and the last time there was a bunch of graffiti all over the house, it was stuffed into a closet, replaced by a life-size replica of the character, which I think she recently made.\nGod! It move!"
 uma_fr_uma.20.a: "God!"
  
 uma_fr_uma.21.desc: "Whoa -- what's the matter, be, have been discovered, meowed, why so unlucky recently..."
 uma_fr_uma.21.a: "What's going on?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.22.desc: "Ahem, um, introduce yourself, I'm Venus Park from Tisput."
 uma_fr_uma.22.a: "You said you are Venus Park？"
  
 uma_fr_uma.23.desc: "It's Venus Park, the popular one in your country. Hey."
 uma_fr_uma.23.a: "Did you say you're from Tisput?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.24.desc: "Yes, the home of [GetGlxName], out of Tisput in the galaxy"
 uma_fr_uma.24.a: "Tisput people are not Umamusume. What's going on?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.25.desc: "Hm hm. [GetGlxName] said that in the plan, I was originally the second Umamusume to be created, but it was put on hold due to the invasion of Suo and was not created until much later."
 uma_fr_uma.25.a: "You were made?"
  
 uma_fr_uma.26.desc: "Yeah, it's not, is it? People back home have told me that I am the real Umamusume, not a false shell, and my master has told me that you are the most powerful and special Umamusume in the whole universe."
 uma_fr_uma.26.a: "All that aside, why are you here? It's illegal to enter the country without permission."
  
 uma_fr_uma.27.desc: "Whoo... It's just that I received some correspondence from [GetGlxName]. To be honest, I didn't expect that my predecessor who I was educated to look up to was a fan of mine. Seems a little strange to say that?"
 uma_fr_uma.27.a: "(Accept the message)"
  
 uma_fr_uma.28.title: "Here is a message from [GetGlxName]"
 uma_fr_uma.28.desc: "Whatever Venus Park thinks, I will agree.\nWhatever Venus Park says, I'm listening.\nIf Venus Park has only one fan, it would be me.\nIf Venus Park didn't have fans, I'd be dead.\n————\nThe unique little braid on the forehead is lovely;\nLittle ears poking out of pierced hat are lovely;\nThe talking blue diamond eyes are lovely;\nI'm sorry, guys. She's so cute!\n————\nI want to blitz!\nWoo Woo ,by cute little Umamusume! --Going out to eat with Venus Park Barffy wiped the cream from the corners of her mouth! My inner defense line is broken! My brain is in trouble! I Surrender!\nSurrendered long ago.\n————\nEvery day with Venus Park is like magic.\nEarly in the morning ,I can see Venus Park's sleeping face, the ears unconsciously flicking gently. She woke and wiped the corners of her mouth, propped up on the bed with one hand, rubbed her sleepy eyes with the other, and did not realize that my shoulder strap had slipped.\nThis is the best day ever! Every day! The best day!"
 uma_fr_uma.28.a: "Wow... What a freak..."
  
 uma_fr_uma.29.title: "Alien"
 uma_fr_uma.29.desc: "In short, the misunderstanding is resolved, Venus Park told us her origin, that the mysterious high-tech ship does belong to her, but she forgot to turn on the optical stealth, and because of the trouble to turn off all the certifications, so alone to find [GetGlxName]. This caused the special Forces to enter the main control room and trigger the Tisput's security back door, sending the entire ship tumbling out of the Galactic system. It can be foreseen that Tisput's technology is far beyond our imagination, and there are obviously countless treasures left in Venus Park here, so we can make her our scientific advisor for the time being until the Tisput people come to see her. The problem is that pampered Venus Park seems "somewhat" messy and could quickly turn into a garbage dump if left alone; But if she lives with [GetGlxName], there may not be much time left for [GetGlxName] to conduct research."
 uma_fr_uma.29.a: "[GetGlxName] This guy sleeps through two-thirds of the day, which is nowhere near the lovely Venus Park!"
 uma_fr_uma.29.b: "Although [GetGlxName] sleeps every day, it is somewhat useful for research, so let them do their jobs."
