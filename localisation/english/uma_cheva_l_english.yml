 uma_cheval.2.title: "Outer Worlds"
 uma_cheval.2.desc: "This is a fantastic world outside the sky. \nThere are no ancient battlefield ruins, no corridors and towers. What comes into view is the vast, lush grassland and the clear river that meanders and flows in it. This grassland is green and full of vitality; this river is like the Milky Way falling into the mortal world, adding a bit of agility and tenderness to this quiet world. The grassland is also dotted with patches of scattered woods, which complement the grassland and form a breathtaking natural picture. The crisp bird calls from time to time in the forest add a bit of vitality and vigor to this quiet world. [Leader.GetName]After measuring that the atmospheric composition here is almost the same as that of Gaia outside the rift, we can finally walk out of our exploration sphere with confidence. 'It's incredible that such a complete and vibrant ecosystem can be nurtured in the rift! 'She even attached a few photos to the report she sent."
 uma_cheval.2.a: "Be cautious"
 uma_cheval.3.title: "Unable to rise to a height"
 uma_cheval.3.desc: ""It looks like a continent," [leader.GetName] said in the report. "It's just a little strange. The sky here seems to have a certain height limit; that is, after rising to a certain height, our equipment will suddenly stall and fall." "But anyway, this is still a good place. If I had to choose, I would stay here forever." The members of the expedition seemed to like it here. At the same time, our low-altitude exploration equipment discovered a man-made building complex similar to a farm not far away, and we planned to go and take a look."
 uma_cheval.3.a: "$FASCINATING$"
 uma_cheval.4.title: "Man-made buildings"
 uma_cheval.4.desc: "We arrived at the designated location very quickly. Almost before we knew it, a country road appeared at our feet, with wheat fields on both sides. The wheat in the wheat field was still a little green. Obviously, in this space, autumn has not yet arrived. Some agricultural harvesters were parked in the fields, and they were also quietly waiting for the time to work. \nSuddenly, [Leader.GetName] pushed everyone into the field. "Hush-someone is coming." Everyone quickly dispersed and hid in the wheat field. Due to the obstruction of the wheat, we could not tell what the creature passing by was, but we could clearly hear a song'You are the beam of light that cannot be blocked.....'"
 uma_cheval.4.a: "Is she a Umamusume?"
 uma_cheval.5.title: "Keep exploring"
 uma_cheval.5.desc: "When the singing gradually faded away, the team members carefully came out of the wheat field and continued to explore the farm. Was that creature a Umamusume? Or did we happen to understand her language? Why was she here? We continued to set off with the same questions."
 uma_cheval.5.a: "Be careful"
 uma_cheval.6.title: "Tiny House"
 uma_cheval.6.desc: "When we reached the end of the road, we found a small house. The house was not big, but it was clean and tidy. According to the inspection of the house, the owner of the house was most likely a Umamusume. But why did the Umamusume appear in this crack? Maybe we should ask her herself. \nWe were squatting in front of the door to discuss the next plan. "Ah!" A voice sounded behind us, followed by the sound of hurried running. When we looked back, we saw a Umamusume wearing a white hat running in the opposite direction."
 uma_cheval.6.a: "Catch up"
 uma_cheval.6.b: "Find a way to contact her"
 uma_cheval.7.title: "Run away!"
 uma_cheval.7.desc: "We lost track of the Umamusume. The Umamusume has amazing endurance, and even if we are faster than her, there is no chance of winning. We have no choice but to return to the Rift Exploration Sphere to discuss the next step. \nOur team is divided into two groups. One group advocates returning directly, because it seems that there is no need to continue exploring here. The other group wants to figure out how this space was created, but the only clue now is to directly ask the owner of this area - a Umamusume."
 uma_cheval.7.a: "Give up"
 uma_cheval.7.b: "I think we need to continue"
 uma_cheval.8.title: "Dislocated time"
 uma_cheval.8.desc: "We decided to continue to investigate this place. The ecosystems here are very rich and complete, and we can assert that this is a flat mirror image of our world. \nExcept for time\nWe found that the time here is abnormal. According to our judgment of the change in the solar altitude angle, we have not stayed in this space for more than 6 hours, but our mission timer clearly shows the passage of external time. \nThis is exactly: one day here is a thousand years in the world. \nBut because the height of this space is limited, we cannot assert whether this is caused by a black hole or a high-mass celestial body that can cause gravitational distortion."
 uma_cheval.8.a: "The time doesn't match"
 uma_cheval.9.title: "Confessions"
 uma_cheval.9.desc: "We met the Umamusume again not far from the hut, but this time she didn't notice us. \nShe was eating something with her head down, and there was a fishing rod next to her. It seemed that she was enjoying fishing. \n"I don't know if the group of Umamusumes have left. But how did they get here... No, no, how can I... think like this." \nShe took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. \n"What has the world outside become?" "But, a Umamusume like me..." "Senior, what should I... do?" \nThe Umamusume lay on the grass and covered her face with her hat. \n"How much material is left in this place? I don't know, I'll think of it then." "It's so hot, then, jump to the sunset." \nShe waved her hand, and the sun began to move at a speed visible to the naked eye, and finally stopped at the top of the mountain. \nIt seems that she can control the time here."
 uma_cheval.9.a: "When negotiating with her, remember to be gentle"
 uma_cheval.9.b: "Keep watching"
 uma_cheval.10.title: "Talk"
 uma_cheval.10.desc: "[leader.GetName] quietly approached her, sat next to her, and tried to talk to her: \n"What's your name?" \n"Wooah!" She jumped up from the ground "You, you, you, you heard everything? Wow....!" \n Her face flushed, but soon she regained her composure. \n"I...I...I, my name is Cheval Grand, and I aspire to be a...great Umamusume. Of course, now, great or something..." She still didn't dare to look [Leader.GetName] in the eye, and her voice became lower and lower. \nIn the subsequent conversation, she also expressed the idea which wanting to get out. After all, it is not a good idea to stay here for a lifetime. \n"As for this space... I don't know how it was formed. I only know that our original physical norms were overturned, and then we entered the process of the universe re-creation as those scientists said. Then I was pushed into this place in a panic..."\n"The matter here is conserved, and time is also a kind of matter, so when I move time, a piece of land here will disappear again...""Although life here is beautiful, but, but, I still want to go out and take a look." She turned around, as if she didn't dare to look at us."
 uma_cheval.10.a: "Then bring her out."
  
 uma_cheval.11.title: "Departure"
 uma_cheval.11.desc: "After getting her consent, we started to walk towards the Star Exploration Sphere with Cheval Grand's luggage. She didn't say a word along the way, and only answered timidly when we asked questions. From her mouth, we learned that these machines were made by Cheval Grand herself using the materials at hand. Although they were obviously behind the times, they were still usable. \nIn the end, we pulled the anchor chain and took this lost Umamusume out of her little world."
 uma_cheval.11.a: "A genius officer."
 uma_cheval.12.title: "Nothing"
 uma_cheval.12.desc: "We squatted in the grass by the river and continued to observe. We thought something new would happen soon, but it turned out to be the opposite. The fish hadn't been hooked, and the Umamusume seemed to be asleep. At this time, the sky was getting darker and darker. According to the laws of events in this space, a long time had passed outside. We had no choice but to get up and prepare to talk to her."
 uma_cheval.12.a: "This is the only way"
  
 uma_cheval.13.title: "Great..."
 uma_cheval.13.desc: "After settling down, Cheval Grand spent a lot of time adapting to our world. \nBecause of her excellent management skills in the academy, she was naturally recommended to be our £official£ administrator. \nAlthough she still tried her best to shirk responsibility, saying that she was a super social phobic, and she couldn't help but run away when she looked at someone; and because of her melancholy personality, she was easily bullied by others, etc. When we can hear from her words, she is still full of expectations for this job."
 uma_cheval.13.a: "Just let him do it."
