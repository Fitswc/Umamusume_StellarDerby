 origin_uma_below_threegodness_desc: "I don't know when the world's first individual who can be called a "Umamusume" appeared.\nShe may have looked up at the stars, or she may have walked on the same ground that we are walking on.\nOr perhaps starting with her, the thirst for running that is imprinted in the soul of every Umamusume is evident.\nAncient myths have been passed down to us from generation to generation, stories of the mysterious Three Goddesses who gave life to our ancestors, and many people are still convinced of this today.\nIf the legend is true, for what purpose did the Three Goddesses create our species, and where did they go afterwards? \nWe looks up and cannot see the answers hidden behind the curtain of stars.\n What is the meaning of our existence and running?\nWe wants to know the truth, so we run to the sea of stars and follow the trail of legends ......"

 origin_uma_candleoff: "Burnt out embers"
 origin_uma_candleoff_desc: "The stars are not as warm as we imagine, it will tear us into pieces of smile.\nOur gentleness and trust have been rewarded with the blood and the cries of our people.\nThe grassland running in the sunset is scorched, and only the smoke and dust that never dissipates fills the head.\nThe stars were nowhere to be seen, only the battleships that obscured the sun.\nThe survivors survived, guerrilla in the wilderness of their homeland, and then one day, years later, we found a ray of life.\nWe are surrounded not only by the civilisations that have brutalized us, but also by two equally powerful ones. They began to fight for our territory, and when the defenders were empty, we finally captured a starbase.\nWe don't lose to them, we lose to ourselves. After this, there is no kindness.\nBy the time they finally notice our struggle, it will be too late.\nWe should be grateful that they have taught us the laws of this universe, and we respond with destruction.\nIn the midst of the war, we were born again."
  
 origin_uma_business_MAN: "Business Master"
 origin_uma_business_MAN_desc: "Merchants, the medium of material exchange, have always existed in our society since the beginning of written records. \nOf course, as merchants became more and more important in material exchange, what they could control gradually expanded from simple wealth to other things. At that time, the prosperity and decline of the empire gradually became no longer determined by the number of troops. \nWhen science and technology advanced and the economy developed, our eyes also turned from the ground to the boundless stars, as merchants, the business thinking has been deeply engraved in our heads. \nWe are not like other reckless countries that rely on fleets and armies to conquer the galaxy; our way is more elegant, our way is more wise, and our way can destroy a country invisibly."
