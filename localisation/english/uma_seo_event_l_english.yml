 uma_soe_anolomy_desc: "Our scientists made a surprising discovery while scanning the planet's surface - one of our research ships is parked somewhere on the surface!"
  
 uma_soe.2.name: "Defectors"
 uma_soe.2.desc: "The report sent back by the research ship confirmed their previous speculation: there is indeed a research ship belonging to us docked on the surface of the planet. \nSince any undeclared interstellar voyage is prohibited, we believe it is necessary to send an investigation team to investigate the incident and be prepared to arrest the relevant personnel when necessary. \nThere is only one question: who should handle this matter?"
 uma_soe.2.a: "Directly ask the research ship where [this.leader] is to send a team to investigate."
 uma_soe.2.b: "Send the military out - that's what they do."
  
 uma_soe.3.name: "Isolated from the world"
 uma_soe.3.desc: "Our investigation team found a research ship in a river valley. \nThe research ship is in good condition and can take off and return to the team at any time, but the pilot is missing. \nBut we have found out the owner of the ship - a Umamusume named Sound of the Earth."
 uma_soe.3.desc.tr: "我们的调查队伍在一处河谷找到了科研船。\n科研船的状况良好，随时可以起飞回归队伍，但却少了驾驶员的影子。\n但是我们已经查明该舰船的主人——一个叫做万籁争鸣的马娘。\n她曾公然挑战国家，犯下数次对国家不敬的罪行，在数据库中有记录留存。\n如今她驾驶舰船出逃的事实已经查明，现在主动权在我们手里了。"  <"Our investigation team found a research ship in a river valley. \nThe research ship is in good condition and can take off and return to the team at any time, but the pilot is missing. \nBut we have found out the owner of the ship - a horse girl named Sound Of the Earth. \nShe once openly challenged the country and committed several crimes of disrespecting the country, which are recorded in the database. \nNow that the fact that she drove the ship to escape has been found out, the initiative is in our hands."
 uma_soe.3.a: "Ignore the pilot and drive the research ship away"
 uma_soe.3.b: "Ensure the integrity of the ship and send a team to search the surrounding area"
 uma_soe.3.c: "Enter the spacecraft and check the internal facilities and structures"
  
 uma_soe.4.name: "Found the Fugitive!"
 uma_soe.4.desc: "Despite the effort, our search team managed to find Sound Of the Earth hiding nearby. \nThis creature is clearly terrified, and her legs are shaking like a lamb. It seems that she clearly knows the fate that awaits her. \nNow it's time to wrap up - should we continue the search?"
 uma_soe.4.a: "No search, just escort the prisoner back to the home planet"
 uma_soe.4.b: "Continue to search the spacecraft the prisoners were on and check the internal facilities and structures."
  
 uma_soe.5.name: "Caged Bird"
 uma_soe.5.desc: "Sound Of The Earth, who was escorted back to China, was cursed during the parade and was eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison for multiple crimes."
 uma_soe.5.a: "She deserved it."
  
 uma_soe.6.name: "In vain"
 uma_soe.6.desc: "Despite the best efforts of the search parties we sent out, the perpetrator has yet to be found. \nMost of the team members believe she is dead, but some still firmly believe she is alive. \nNow is the time to make a decision."

 uma_soe.8.name: "Evidence of treason"
 uma_soe.7.desc: "Our search team found a batch of projection storage units in the projection room inside the ship. \nThe surface of the projection unit has the signature of the ship owner: Sound of the Earth, and the content was obviously completed not long ago. \nThis batch of projection series roughly tells a story like this: \nOn our home planet: [this.capital_star], Umamusume only account for a small part of the residents. Instead, most of the residents are replaced by a creature called "human" - without ears and tails, but with two genders. \nA girl who is a "human" yearns for the free running of Umamusume. By chance, she reached a cooperative relationship with a somewhat crazy horse girl chemist: she provided drugs for the girl, and the girl had to provide her with all the data she needed. \nThe girl who signed the contract put on her own cardboard box and entered the academy dedicated to Umamusume under the pseudonym "§Y纸箱挽歌§!" and began her own journey of conquest. \nThe journey was not smooth sailing. The girl did not win a single victory in the next two years, but her body was tortured by drugs. Unable to bear all this, the girl took an overdose of drugs and eventually defeated another horse girl who was favored by the public in the competition - but the price was the loss of memory and the ability to walk. \nAt the end of the film, the girl who lost everything saw the broadcast of the horse girl competition after school, but immediately chased after her friend after hearing his call. \nIs it a human who admires Umamusume, or a human who unfortunately got the "horse girl soul"? The search captain sighed. \nAt this time, a voice came from behind: This is the path she chose herself, so there is no need to feel sad."
 uma_soe.8.desc: "Our search team found a batch of projection storage units in the projection room inside the ship. \nThe surface of the projection unit has the signature of the ship owner: Sound of The Earth, and the content is obviously completed not long ago. \nJust as we predicted: the film is full of this reactionary element's slander against the sacred species of Umamusume: inferior species similar to Umamusume dominate all aspects of the earth, and inferior species are so bold as to meddle in Umamusume's sacred competition! \nJust when a search team member couldn't stand it anymore and was about to smash the projection unit, Sound of The Earth rushed out from nowhere, knocked the search team member to the ground, and used his body to protect the projection unit tightly."
 uma_soe.7.a: "Ha! The fugitive fell into his own trap"
 uma_soe.8.a: "A futile struggle"
  
 uma_soe.9.name: "An artist"
 uma_soe.9.desc: "The search team members, awakened from their dreams, quickly controlled Sound Of the Earth, who did not resist. \nBased on her confession, the search team concluded the reason why she flew away alone: to find an environment where no one would disturb her, nothing more. \nSince her goal had been achieved, there was no need for her to continue hiding. \nThe reason for the escape was unbelievable, but the search team had no time to think about it, and now they had to decide the fate of the fugitive."
 uma_soe.9.a: "Bring back the sound of nature and her creations"
  
 uma_soe.10.name: "Supernova"
 uma_soe.10.desc: "Sound Of The Earth was escorted back to China, but her ship was confiscated instead of being imprisoned. \nOnce her work was published, it immediately caused a sensation in the art world, and creations related to "humanity" became a hot topic."
 uma_soe.10.a: "Really good"
  
 uma_soe.11.name: "The End of the Traitor"
 uma_soe.11.desc: "By the time Sound of The Earth realized what she had done, it was too late. \nThe search team quickly controlled her, and no matter how she struggled, it was useless. \nNow it was time for her to stand trial."
 uma_soe.11.a: "Justice finally prevails"
  
 uma_soe.12.name: "From victory to victory"
 uma_soe.12.desc: "When Sound Of The Earth was escorted back to China, she lost almost everything. Her freedom, her property, and even her dwindling reputation. It is conceivable that even after serving twenty years in prison, her life was destined to be spent in contempt."
 uma_soe.12.a: "Good"
