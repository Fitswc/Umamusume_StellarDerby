uma_finemotion.2.desc: "Good Day, I was Princess Fine Motion." #缩减：爱尔兰
uma_finemotion.2.a: "Princess, why did you find me?"
uma_finemotion.3.desc: "What a great country. Everyone is smiling and happy."
uma_finemotion.3.a: "So, excuse me..."
uma_finemotion.4.desc: "Are you the leader of this country? I'd like to study and explore this country. Is that OK?"
uma_finemotion.4.b: "Of course"
uma_finemotion.4.a: "Who ?"
uma_finemotion.4.a.respon: "......"

uma_finemotion.6.desc: "Woah! So this is the digging site?"
uma_finemotion.6.a: "Fine Motion, what are you doing here?"
uma_finemotion.7.desc: "<Look left and right>"
uma_finemotion.7.a: "Your highness?"
uma_finemotion.8.desc: "Mm mm, is this your country's survey instrument... What a strange shape."
uma_finemotion.8.a: "Wait, how did you get here?"
uma_finemotion.9.desc: "It was the captain who brought me here in a spaceship. The ruins here..."
uma_finemotion.9.a: "The site of a lost civilization, and our experts are looking for anything useful."
uma_finemotion.10.desc: "Lost civilization -- < Close her eyes >"
uma_finemotion.10.a: "Your highness?"
uma_finemotion.11.desc: "Yeah, yeah, I'll tell her. Leave it to me."
uma_finemotion.11.a: "Who are you talking to?"
uma_finemotion.12.desc: "The elves here, they said they had something for you."
uma_finemotion.12.a: "Get the scientists now!"

uma_finemotion.14.desc: "With scientists working day and night, we managed to crack the technology of a lost civilization."
uma_finemotion.14.a: "OK"
uma_finemotion.15.desc: "We failed to crack it. This technology seems to come from a different plane, and we can't really understand it at our current level. As for the resources invested... Do you want to get the milk out of the sea?"
uma_finemotion.15.a: "Bad"
uma_finemotion.16.desc: "......"
uma_finemotion.16.a: "Fine Motion, what can I do for you?"
uma_finemotion.17.desc: "Don't be so inhibited. Just call me beautiful. You seem busy lately?"
uma_finemotion.17.a: "Yes, We are reforming the government"
uma_finemotion.18.desc: "So that's it. My father used to say that the state was a giant machine, but I don't think so. It should be more like a creature, or a person. To constantly eliminate the old things, produce the new, in order to grow healthily."
uma_finemotion.18.a: "......"
uma_finemotion.19.desc: "A Cup of tea?"
uma_finemotion.19.a: "So you just wanted to see me for tea?"
uma_finemotion.20.desc: "Also want to talk to you, your present appearance reminds me of a lot of things, like the past me ah ~ friends ah ~"
uma_finemotion.20.a: "Talk to me?"
uma_finemotion.20.b: "About Fine"
uma_finemotion.20.c: "Your Friends"
uma_finemotion.20.d: "Your Past"
uma_finemotion.20.a.resp: "Well, I wanted to give you a little rest. Exceeding the limit of effort will not bring positive benefits. It will multiply your chances of making a mistake"
uma_finemotion.20.b.resp: "Like you, I have a country on my shoulders. I don't know, looking at you right now is like looking at your old self."
uma_finemotion.20.c.resp: "She is a person who is always calculating. She calculated her limit mathematically, but refused to believe it, always trying to push it down in every way. But all these methods only further prove the accuracy of her results. Calculate -- try to push -- prove -- calculate again. She was caught in a vortex of her own making. I don't want to see that happen to you..."

uma_finemotion.21.desc: "I love my country and I am willing to give my all for it. But I am also just a person, some desires can not be eliminated, excessive repression will only drill the tip of the ox. Well, people get tired all the time. Just do what you want at times like this, like I'm doing right now. Rest is just to work better."
uma_finemotion.21.a: "Thank you"
uma_finemotion.21.a.resp: "You're welcome. If I can, I also want to contribute something to your country, as a good friend!"

uma_finemotion.22.desc: "These are the new battleship blueprints?"
uma_finemotion.22.a: "Yes"
uma_finemotion.23.desc: "< Frowns >......"
uma_finemotion.23.a: "what's wrong"
uma_finemotion.24.desc: "I just -- I don't really like it."
uma_finemotion.24.a: "......."
uma_finemotion.25.desc: "Don't get me wrong, I'm not disapproving of what you're doing. On the contrary, I think you did the right thing."
uma_finemotion.25.a: "Oh?"
uma_finemotion.26.desc: "The existence of power is necessary, we can not use it, but we can not do without it. Strength is the foundation of our existence in this world. What we have to do is decide how to use it. What would you have done?"
uma_finemotion.26.a: "I will conquer the stars with it!"
uma_finemotion.26.b: "I'm gonna use it to protect the country!"
uma_finemotion.26.b.resp: "Ohh, you're right. What we need is the strength to protect others."

uma_finemotion.30.desc: "A sudden trend of Noodles noodles has hit China's social media platforms. In just a few months, the domestic economy of Noodles and its related industries increased by 70%. In the private sector, Noodles-related extremist organizations have even emerged in order to replace all food staples in the restaurant industry with Noodles."

uma_finemotion.31.desc: "Under the continuous tracking of China's network security department, the source of the trend seems to point to the recent hot masked anchor“Noodles Princess”。"
uma_finemotion.31.a: "Access communication......"
uma_finemotion.32.desc: "“Hello ~ This is Noodles UMAtuber... Look good. What can I do for you?”"
uma_finemotion.32.a: "Isn't that suspicious, my Lord Fine Motion?"
uma_finemotion.33.desc: "Hm hm. Was it exposed? I thought I was a good disguise, but what was it?"
uma_finemotion.33.a: "On the first live broadcast, the background bedroom was captured."
uma_finemotion.34.desc: "Huh? It's so early, which means -- were you one of the first people to watch me live?"
uma_finemotion.34.a: "I've been a fan since way back."
uma_finemotion.35.desc: "A little shy. Can you please keep a secret? I don't want the palace to know that I'm UMAtuber, and if they find out, the guards will be staring at me again, and there will be no way to explore the new ramen shop."
uma_finemotion.35.a: "No Problems"
uma_finemotion.36.title: "Private visit"
uma_finemotion.36.desc: "There seems to be something wrong with Fine Motion these days. He always looks distracted and his face is not very good."

uma_finemotion.37.desc: "......."
uma_finemotion.37.a: "Are you OK?"
uma_finemotion.38.desc: "Ahh... What do you mean?"
uma_finemotion.38.a: "You look very pale to me recently. Is something wrong?"
uma_finemotion.39.desc: "Aha, was it found..."
uma_finemotion.39.a: "If you have any difficulties, you can tell me.We are friends."
uma_finemotion.40.desc: "In that case, just listen to me"
uma_finemotion.40.a: "The reason for the poor complexion"
uma_finemotion.40.b: "What are you worried about?"
uma_finemotion.40.c: "Don't worry. We'll protect you. Power is meant to be used at such times!"
uma_finemotion.40.a.resp: "I haven't slept much lately. I've been dreaming about strange things."
uma_finemotion.40.b.resp: "Remember what I said about the elves when we visited the ruins? It's reminding me to be careful.\nIs to be careful of disaster? A shadow? I don't know, they're vague..."
uma_finemotion.40.c.resp: "Thanks......"


uma_finemotion.50.title: "An unexpected end"
uma_finemotion.50.desc: "Fine Motion disappeared without warning, and the area she lived in and around her looked as if it had been bombed. In the face of the broken earth, you realize that she once said "shadow." But it's too late, and as a reward for inaction, you and Fine Motion are left with the wreckage of a place that can no longer be put together."
uma_finemotion.50.a: "Bad......."

uma_finemotion.60.desc: "Put on a stern countenance....."
uma_finemotion.60.a: "What's Wrong"

uma_finemotion.61.desc: "I remembered the dream, and something like a shadow was approaching me."
uma_finemotion.61.a: "Wait, What are you talking about?"

uma_finemotion.62.desc: "I don't know what it is, but it's coming! I'm worried. I have to get ready fast!"
uma_finemotion.62.a: "It was just a nightmare."
uma_finemotion.62.b: "Don't be afraid. I'm here."

uma_finemotion.70.title: "Epilogue"
uma_finemotion.70.desc: "We won. The enemy ships were completely destroyed. The whole nation rejoiced at the end of the crisis. Ramen is still popular in China, but Fine Motion is as if it has never been in the future, the window of the room is still open, and the white curtains are flying lonely. On the server of the video site, the ramen Princess update date is forever fixed on that day."
uma_finemotion.70.a: "OK"

uma_finemotion.74.title: "Trail of the Royal Daughter"
uma_finemotion.74.desc: "After reverse-analyzing the wreckage of the enemy ship, scientists found a set of coordinate data in it. It points to a whole new galaxy that we've never seen before."
uma_finemotion.74.a: "Go!"



uma_finemotion.1001.name: "Land"
uma_finemotion.1001.desc: "Our scientists have done a preliminary scan of the globe and found that this is an ordinary Gaia planet with no trace of any civilization. The specific situation needs to wait for our staff to land and do further exploration."
uma_finemotion.1002.name: "Abnormal reading"
uma_finemotion.1002.desc: "While the scientists were surveying the ground, their instruments seemed to malfunction. The reading on the panel will always appear irregularly and completely opposite to the normal number."
uma_finemotion.1002.a: "What fucking equipment? All new!"
uma_finemotion.1002.b: "Want to find an excuse to cheat funds, no!"
uma_finemotion.1003.name: "Caught in Trap"
uma_finemotion.1003.desc: "By brute force, scientists actually found a pattern in a jumble of statistics. Strictly speaking, it's some kind of energy fluctuation that's different from this plane. The disorder, our scientists speculate, is due to the fact that the time flow rate on that plane is different from our world. This energy increase is consistent with the temporal velocity of that plane. The next step for our scientists will be to search the most energetic regions of the planet for ways to break the game."
uma_finemotion.1004.name: "Be poised for"
uma_finemotion.1004.desc: "The final location was determined to be a spring somewhere in a subtropical inland forest. In the pool surrounded by different kinds of green plants, the clear liquid is pouring out rhythmically, like some rhythm of life. Here, instrument readings have exceeded the measurable range, and scientists are gearing up."
uma_finemotion.1004.a: "Forward"
uma_finemotion.1005.name: "Materialism & Idealism"
uma_finemotion.1005.desc: "The process of discovering the way into the ectopic plane is very interesting, just like the end of O Henry's novel. After working for three days and nights without finding any clue, our excited scientist could not support his tired body and fell asleep in the same place. As a result, they accidentally enter that world through dreams. The human spirit and will exist, but the physical laws they follow are not on the plane of the body. To use a very inappropriate example, in that world, energy is also a matter, and our spirit and mind are usually considered to be an energy, and in this plane it becomes a matter."
uma_finemotion.1005.a: "There is a quarrel between idealism and materialism."
uma_finemotion.1006.name: "Mikoshi"
uma_finemotion.1006.desc: "Finally, the scientists chose the Utopian system, a humanitarian euthanasia technology previously developed in China. Its principle is to digitize all the human spirit to store in the server, only need to reverse programming, people's conscious activities can be converted into digital signal output, and then converted into visual and sound signals to achieve the communication of the two worlds.\nNow All set"
uma_finemotion.1006.a: "Access communication!"


uma_finemotion.80.desc: "Is you......"
uma_finemotion.80.a: "I finally found you. What are you doing here?"
uma_finemotion.81.desc: "It was the elves who saved me and brought me here."
uma_finemotion.81.a: "Are these elves?"
uma_finemotion.82.desc: "Well, more specifically, the conscious energy of a civilization. They once lived in this vast universe, just like us. But one day they discover the essence of the soul - an energy that lies somewhere else. So they broke away from their bodies and became what they are now."
uma_finemotion.82.a: "Then how did you get in here?"
uma_finemotion.83.desc: "Because of my natural ability. Ever since I was a child, I have seen and communicated with these spirits. That's why that thing found me."
uma_finemotion.83.a: "So your body..."
uma_finemotion.84.desc: "Preserved by these children, they can manipulate the matter there through the influence of consciousness and our plane. As they ascend to the energy plane, their negative emotions are separated and they become that thing."
uma_finemotion.84.a: "So they're here to clean up their own mess, too?"
uma_finemotion.85.desc: "Yes, because I can both communicate with the elves and be on that plane, so the negative emotions that materialize find me."
uma_finemotion.85.a: "I'm so glad you're okay! We've destroyed that thing. I'm here to take you back."
uma_finemotion.86.desc: "Thank you. It was so nice to meet you."
uma_finemotion.86.a: "Welcome Back, Fine."

uma_finemotion.87.desc: "Back here again."
uma_finemotion.87.a: "How time flies. It feels like the blink of an eye."
uma_finemotion.88.desc: "It's been a long time since I came here."
uma_finemotion.88.a: "I can't remember, but it seems like a lot happened."
uma_finemotion.89.desc: "Oh, I always feel that I and you are very compatible"
uma_finemotion.89.a: "Funny, I was thinking the same thing"
uma_finemotion.90.desc: "I really don't want to go back..."
uma_finemotion.90.a: "Are you leaving?"
uma_finemotion.91.desc: "Yeah, people are still waiting for me."
uma_finemotion.91.a: "Can't just stay a little longer."
uma_finemotion.92.desc: "Ah, do you want me to stay longer?"
uma_finemotion.92.a: "If I can, I hope not just for a while."
uma_finemotion.92.a.resp: "Well, if you say so, we'll meet again someday."
uma_finemotion.93.title: "Leave"
uma_finemotion.93.desc: "Fine Motion is gone, but the time spent with her is etched in your heart. All you can do is watch the ship disappear over the horizon, hoping to see it again."
uma_finemotion.93.a: "Bye......"
uma_finemotion.94.desc: "Hello, my family has decided to enter into a cooperation agreement with your government. I am Fine Motion as the ambassador. Please kindly advise me."
uma_finemotion.94.a: "Thank you for your advice. Fine."
uma_finemotion.94.a.resp: "This time, it won't be so easy."
