uma_bourbon_anomaly_desc: "The research ship [From.GetName] found [This.GetName] to be an eerie, plant-covered planet. After repeated plant attacks above the atmosphere, the research ship [From.GetName] obtained enough samples.\nThe analysis revealed that these "plants" had no cellular structure, and it was clear that further study of the planet was necessary."
uma_bourbon_anomaly_second: "§HPlant Heaven§!"
uma_bourbon_anomaly_second_desc: "The abnormal large-scale growth of plants on a tropical planet [this.getname] in the galaxy, the density of vegetation far exceeds the estimated environmental capacity, almost covering the entire planet, and further research is needed to investigate this phenomenon."

uma_bour_arc.2.desc: "Scientists [This.GetLeaderName] managed to isolate the pheromones that steel plants use to identify each other and coat them on a small craft to get inside [From.GetName], but communication was temporarily cut off."
uma_bour_arc.2.a: "Well, I guess we'll just have to wait now"
uma_bour_arc.3.title: "MIAⅡ"

uma_bour_arc.4.title: "Way Home"
uma_bour_arc.4.desc: "A familiar signal appears on our communication channel, the scientist [This.GetLeaderName] is back! She describes the earth's surface covered by plants: the earth's crust is made of metal, and plant roots stretch across and even down into the earth's crust. In addition, she found some passageways on the surface to the underground."
uma_bour_arc.4.a: "This is exciting news! Send an archaeological team!"
uma_bour_arc.4.b: "That's fine, but maybe the cost of sending out the rescue team could be put on the [This.GetLeaderName] payroll?"
uma_bour_arc.4.c: "But I still want to blow up these vines."

uma_bour_arc.5.desc: "The bombing of the planet unleashed a burst of energy that completely destroyed our fleet."
uma_bour_arc_damn: "Damn It!"

uma_bourbon_arc: "Under the iron forest"
uma_bour_arc_desc: "Along the marked safe passage, the pheromone coated transport ship successfully passed through the vine corridor, and given the aggressive nature of the vine, the archaeological team deployed a special operations team to deal with any danger that might arise. The entrance to the underground has been identified, and although the team can easily access the underground passages because the gates are not locked, these intricate passages will obviously take some time to explore."
uma_bourbon_arc_second: "Secret flowers and plants"
uma_bour_arc_second_desc: "The initial exploration found that most of the buildings on the surface had been eroded by plants, but the underground buildings were still intact, and the exploration target was the underground facilities of the entire planet.\nBecause the vegetation is so dense, the oxygen content of the planet's atmosphere is far beyond Umamusume's tolerance, so special protective equipment must be worn."

uma_bour_arc.6.title: "Mechanical power"
uma_bour_arc.6.desc: "The team eventually emerged from the maze into an open underground space that seemed to be connected by the roots of plants and abandoned buildings.\nThe team was attacked on the road near the abandoned city, and some human-shaped machinery powered by an unknown energy source rushed at the team at high speed, but the combat team was well equipped to avoid injuries.\nVideo analysis showed that these bipedal machines were moving at extremely fast speeds, even slightly faster than the highest speed recorded by Umamusume. Perhaps there is something in this.\nThere's another mechanical body coming up, it looks like there's still a long way to go..."
uma_bour_arc.6.a: "The quest continues. Keep safe"
uma_bour_arc.7.title: "Nuance"
uma_bour_arc.7.desc: "After disposing of a small number of mechanical bodies, the team set up a position outside the abandoned city. While studying the combat video, the scientists [This.GetLeaderName] noticed only slight differences in the movement patterns of the mechanical bodies and Umamusume. The report and the combat video have been sent back to the research institute for further comparison.\nIn order to avoid attracting too many mechanical bodies, the team decided to send only two teams for the initial exploration, and the rest to rest in the stronghold.\nSoon, Team A arrived at the most similar "scientific research institution" building in the whole city, but it was blocked by the access control system that has not stopped running, and the decoding work is hot.\nOn the other side, Team B, went to the city's library, or "database," and began gathering intelligence about the city."
uma_bour_arc.7.a: "Good"
uma_bour_arc.8.title: "Shroud, Factor and Realm"
uma_bour_arc.8.desc: "The information about this underground city was uploaded to the terminal by the B team one after another, the city named "Norrecki", is the scientific research city of the ancient civilization "Tispruit", the planet named "Enlightenment", is Tispruit's home planet. The Tisputs are a highly scientific civilization, and unlike the so-called materialist civilizations, the Tisputs do not reject Shroud, on the contrary, they almost universally embrace Shroud in order to study its nature.\nIn addition, the database has repeatedly mentioned the existence of Umamusume in Tisput, so the "factors" and "fields" unique to Umamusume have also been included in its research scope.\nThere's no record in the database of the reason for Tisput's demise."
uma_bour_arc.8.a: "How's the other team doing?"
uma_bour_arc.9.title: "Shroud Mechanical Research Institute"
uma_bour_arc.9.desc: "We had just taken over the big library, and as the database continued to sync, the team agreed that Tisput's deepest secrets were hidden in the main research building, so the members of the stronghold stormed out to the location of Team A.\nBy this time, Team A had cracked the security system of the scientific research facility and was the first to enter it, which was then attacked by the mechanical Umamusume until the entire building was finally controlled.\nWhile the members of the archaeological team wondered whether they were participating in an archaeological mission or a combat mission, they found a large number of "mechanical life" in the building, which is consistent with the plants on the surface of the planet, and it is not difficult to guess that the mechanical Umamusume was also the product of Tisput's experiments.\nIn addition to these, there are a lot of experimental data on robotics, artificial intelligence, Shroud theory, which is very helpful."
uma_bour_arc.9.a: "So, what are they trying to study with all this?"
uma_bour_arc.10.title: "Finally..."
uma_bour_arc.10.desc: "Now, there's only one room in the entire building that's not open, and it's so encrypted that our team can't do anything about it.\nWhat to do next... ?"
uma_bour_arc.10.a: "Look into Tisput's database for clues."
uma_bour_arc.10.b: "Get experts from all over the country to help."
uma_bour_arc.10.c: "Dynamite"
uma_bour_arc.11.title: "Cyber-Umamusume"
uma_bour_arc.11.desc: "The door to the basement was finally opened, the anticipated battle did not occur, and there was only one incubator and one chair in the large room.\nThis incubator is carrying a §YUmamusume§!, After examination, the "Umamusume" §Y in the incubator was not an organic organism.§!, In line with the mechanical Umamusume outside, her body is also §Ymade entirely of machinery§!, But in contrast to the apparently mechanical "Umamusume," this Umamusume looks like an ordinary Umamusume.\nIn addition, an unencrypted electronic document was found in the compartment of the incubator, on which a lot of data was recorded in a dense detail in the Tisput's language.\nThe exploration of Norrecki City is over, and there is a long process of data sorting ahead."
uma_bour_arc.11.a: "Translate it as confidential"
uma_bour_arc.12.title: "EndⅠ"
uma_bour_arc.12.desc: ""This is Tisput's chief scientist §YK§!. The Umamusume by my side named §Y "Mihono" §! As you can see, she is a mechanical body and a living body, the crystallization of our Tisput wisdom, but unfortunately I did not have time to push her to perfection, "Order Protocol" appeared in the next galaxy, they only hunt creatures with souls, our fleet did not have time to react." "So I killed her."\n"Don't be surprised, Umamusume people are far older than you and I think, maybe they are the first intelligent life in this universe, maybe their" soul "has a special mechanism, or maybe they are not living in this universe at all... I'm sorry to use the word "soul," which materialists don't like very much, but we really can't go any further."\n"If our experiment is successful, then in the future, as I suspect, there will be an individual similar to her, perhaps named 'Mihono', but not necessarily."\n"By the way, the mechanical Umamusume produced by the failed experiments outside, as well as the mechanical plants, are the programs I wrote in their systems to" automatically attack similar beings, "and this text will only show up when a certain number of Umamusume experiments are destroyed."\n"Presumably no one would destroy a nonthreatening robot, so only Umamusume would have access to the information."\n"It's not that I didn't expect to be discovered by other civilizations, but these are not very important things, at most to help you avoid the detours, in addition to the data recorded below, there are some contents in the Mihono database, including our creator has not figured out things."\n"Speaking of which, it probably doesn't feel good to kill a fellow human being, so how about I apologize, and these numbers are an apology?"\nSo much for the writer's description, that's all data."
uma_bour_arc.12.a: "Okay..."
uma_bour_arc.13.title: "The end of Tisput?"
uma_bour_arc.13.desc: "The search for enlightenment is over, and although data collation is still going on, everyone's mind is still on that message. How is mechanical Umamusume made? What does "K" mean by producing similar individuals? Why is Umamusume, a species that has experienced so many faults, still active in the galaxy?\nMost of the data has been classified and sealed, and the scholars involved in the exploration and translation have been called in to work on ideas to avoid leaks. Tisput has disappeared into the long river of history, but in any case, as this great scientist said, their research has saved us a lot of detours, and we will carry on with the wishes of our predecessors.\n"
uma_bour_arc.13.a: "To the truth!"
uma_bour_arc.13.b: "The Three Goddesses will lead our way!"
uma_bour_arc.13.c: "Hail the pioneers."
uma_bour_arc.16.title: "Database transaction"
uma_bour_arc.16.desc: "After reaching a new level of factor control, we were able to parse the part of the mechanical Umamusume database with the password, which was made up of several factor structures that were completely unresolvable for non-umamusume races, but as easy as 123456 for us who had completed the "Fly me to the star" program.\nThe decoded content has only one coordinate, pointing to a galaxy with no hyperspace channel, which is shrouded in clouds, so our detectors can't probe inside."
uma_bour_arc.16.a: "Send out three unmanned probes with jump engines."
uma_bour_arc.16.b: "Jump!"
uma_bour_arc.17.title: "Cut off from the world"
uma_bour_arc.17.desc: "The whole system is calmer than we expected, with no potentially threatening fleets or Leviathan creatures, and no debris, it looks like a normal galaxy, and it's obvious that we should send out a research ship to look for clues."
uma_bour_arc.17.a: "Quiet"
uma_bour_arc.18.title: "Tropical Heaven"
uma_bour_arc.18.desc: "The investigation found that the energy conversion efficiency and chloroplast activity of the plants on [From.GetName] were unusually high, and the scientists [This.GetLeaderName] found traces of ancient civilization activity in the understory of the vegetation on the planet, which combined with the mechanical plant life previously found on Tisput, it was necessary to establish an archaeological site."
uma_bour_arc.20.title: "Big Bugs!"
uma_bour_arc.20.desc: "The scientists, who had just carved out their camp in a relatively flat patch of ground, were attacked by a swarm of giant flying insects! These winged arthropods, all of which have evolved into nearly fist-sized individuals due to high levels of atmospheric oxygen, pounce on the camp in droves.\nIn order to avoid causing a large fire, the team was forbidden to use flamethrowers for protection, so they had to temporarily abandon the ground camp, and instead dug a hole in the ground.\nThe good news is that these large arthropods are succulent and full of nutrients, and although some members were resistant at first, as the smell of barbecued insects spread, the entire camp began to eat these insects, and it was suggested that they could be farmed in a high-oxygen environment to ease the food pressure.\nThat said, these big bugs are seriously affecting progress, and we need a little time to deal with them..."
uma_bour_arc.20.a: "Taste Good..."
uma_bour_arc.21.title: "Colorful"
uma_bour_arc.21.desc: "The team extracted a substance from local plants to repel the mosquitoes. No longer disturbed, they began to move further into the jungle.\nOne of the teams found a strange area where, in addition to green, a number of gold, red, blue, black and even white leaf plants were scattered here, and the distance between each color was consistent, as if there were signs of artificial cultivation.\nThe team conducted a preliminary analysis of the white-leaved plant, and the results showed that most of its energy came from other plants, and it seemed to rely on parasitically feeding on other plants for energy supply, as did other odd-colored leaves, and scientists found a number of fossils underground in this area.\nIt's time to start an investigation around here."
uma_bour_arc.21.a: "Keep Going"
uma_bour_arc.22.title: "The Past"
uma_bour_arc.22.desc: "Archaeologists found a §YCrypt§! stuffed with plants under a giant shrub nearby. After a search, some strange necklaces, grotesque drawings, and carved a wall of text, these words do not have consecutive sentences, only a single word and symbols after it. No special energy was detected on these necklaces and patterns, which are presumed to be the product of some religious belief.\nThe clue seems to be broken here, given that the galactic coordinates are from the mechanical Umamusume, archaeologists once again turned their attention to the Tisput database, after the completion of the Tisput archaeology, the database is almost too large to accommodate the limit, so it is not easy to find out the data about this kind of writing in a short time.\nCoupled with the fact that the matter is classified, and only some scientists who have signed non-disclosure agreements or are directly affiliated with the state can participate in the search, it is clear that it will take some time."
uma_bour_arc.22.a: "OK"
uma_bour_arc.23.title: "The PastⅡ"
uma_bour_arc.23.desc: "After a lot of comparison, the language was finally locked down to "§K Santance language §!" This civilization is called "Santivano." That is, this plant-rich planet is called "§K Exquisite §!" It is the capital of the Santance.\nThe following is a brief overview of the Santance content in the Tisput database.\nSantance is a §H Idealist §! Oligarchic civilization has something to do with Tisput. At first, when Tisput had not yet developed the FTL engine, it was an indigenous nation within the territory of Tivano Santance. Santance did not interfere in the development of Tisput. Later, in a losing war, Santance was forced to cede Tisput's Zhantai system to a slave state.\nTisput was naturally colonized, but the war did not end, and neither power had time to pay attention to the indigenous country, and the Tisput, with its access to higher technology, took advantage of the materialist trend in civilization, and technology rapidly developed to a degree that could not be ignored. Eventually, the Tisput Resistance, led by an agent codenamed "70", collaborates with Santance to defeat the slavery empire on the one hand, and initiates a §RRebellion§! within Santance on the other. A large number of suppressed scientists and Democrats joined Tisput, and Santance was weakened by the long war, and eventually lost to Tisput.\nAfter the war, Tispt could not handle the large number of believers, so he retained the capital of Santance, Linglong, as a host planet for the management of a large number of religious people.\nThe follow-up content is still being translated and sorted out."
uma_bour_arc.23.a: "Okay"
uma_bour_arc.24.title: "Log"
uma_bour_arc.24.desc: "From Tisput's database, we learned the location of Linglongstar's administrative core, and except for a few scientists who were left behind to conduct biology-related research, the rest of the team moved to the original administrative core site.\nViewed from space, the coordinates were completely covered in jungle, and when archaeologists arrived, they were shocked by what they saw -- the trees were covered with plants of a jumble of colors, like the drawings of a toddler; The only buildings that remain are those that resemble the medieval style and do not at all resemble the remains of an interstellar civilization.\nFortunately, the team still found some interstellar age relics underground, but they could not directly find the remains of government or scientific institutions, and the team had to search door to door, which would obviously take a lot of time."
uma_bour_arc.24.a: "OK"
uma_bour_arc.25.title: "The PastⅢ"
uma_bour_arc.25.desc: "After some trouble, the team eventually found their way to the city's administrative offices, where they uploaded all the data they could find to a terminal for the analysis team, and then began scanning around with their instruments, ignoring a very prominent log, which resulted in several people being fined a week's supply of dessert.\nWe have translated the whole thing, which appears to be the work of a Tisput scientist born in Santance:\n"She died, and instead of leaving with the Tispt homestead fleet, I came home, and the Tispts helped me block the superlumens of this system." This is my 60th year back at Santance, and when the data repair failed, there was nothing to do, so I wrote some journals for posterity, which she always asked me to do, but I didn't like the trouble."\n"The dimensional space-time on Linglong is unstable, so there are always people who somehow get Shroud, and by the way, has she ever tried to give" §H Mihono §!" Install the Shroud plugin again?"\n"Well, it's not practical to create a Mihono here, but I can try to use Shroud to try to create a mimetic soul to attract the soul of Umamusume to the planet..."\n"I don't know how long I have to wait, so I might as well get some sleep. I have created a Umamusume sensor based on Mihono's data, and if there is a Umamusume spirit reaction on the planet, I will wake up immediately."\n“Good Night, k.”\n……\n"Can I actually wake up, if my database is OK, and the time it went into hibernation as a starting point is November 24, 7070, which is only seven thousand years ago?"\n"It's as if these religious extremists destroyed their own civilization and then rebuilt it again. It's just the Middle Ages. It's really dark."\n"I woke up to say that Umamusume was indeed born on this planet and it was time to go."\n……\n\nIt is not known whether the "k" described in this journal is the same person as the scientist who created the mechanical body Umamusume."
uma_bour_arc.25.a: "Oh, that's confusing"
uma_bour_arc.26.title: "Blue rose"
uma_bour_arc.26.desc: "After carrying large probes to the planet, scientists found a surprising clue: the existence of an extremely weak "§H Realm §!" The reaction, this response in line with the eminent leaders of our country, means that Umamusume did live here.\nBased on the energy response, the team finally located the source of the field response in front of a large tree in the center of the Santance Capital - §B a bush of blue roses§!. Next to the blue rose were also a large number of colorful parasitic plants, but none of them could come close to this small piece of blue rose bush.\nThe scientist [This.GetLeaderName] decided not to go near the Blue Rose for the time being, but to explore the surroundings, looking for clues to Umamusume and the message left by the Tisput scientist, while other members took data from the Blue Rose bushes outside a certain range."
uma_bour_arc.26.a: "Go!"
uma_bour_arc.27.title: "Cryptic signal"
uma_bour_arc.27.desc: "Without much progress in the investigation, two members of the group trespassed into the Blue Rose Bush in order to obtain more accurate data, and were soon dragged out by ropes in a trance.\nAccording to the two, inside the Blue Rose, they felt a chilling feeling behind them, as if someone was holding a knife behind them, but there was no one behind them.\nThe scientists [This.GetLeaderName] were forbidden to go near the Blue Rose bushes, and as the team ran out of ideas, someone reported finding a Shroud reaction.\nThe team followed the Shroud signal to a narrow cave where only one person could pass through a gap in the rocks. The team dropped a small camera into the cave, but there was nothing inside."
uma_bour_arc.27.a: "Let's call it a day"

uma_bour_arc.30.title: "Draw water with a bamboo basket"
uma_bour_arc.30.desc: "Despite the discovery of relics and the journal of a Santance scientist, no substantial progress has been made, the team's morale is low, and the scientific department is meeting to discuss whether to stop the archaeological work.\nSome have suggested that Umamusume, who owns the realm, try to release the realm of Blue Rose, and there are even people who want to move "Mihono" here, but these actions are obviously blind and unfounded.\nWe urgently need to decide where to go from here."
uma_bour_arc.30.a: "It's a waste of resources. Move on."
uma_bour_arc.30.b: "It doesn't matter. Enough money."
uma_bour_arc.31.title: "§BBlue Rose§!"
uma_bour_arc.31.desc: "The Central sent a Umamusume with a strong field and forced it into a container under the influence of the Blue Rose field, and it was to be sent to the Central laboratory."
uma_bour_arc.32.title: "Whimsical"
uma_bour_arc.32.desc: "After many discussions, the scientific research department finally agreed to move the mechanical body Umamusume to the "exquisite", rather than unrealistic imagination, the previously discovered log mentioned that "attracting the soul of Umamusume to be born on this planet" is the reason for the scientific research Department to make this decision.\nHowever, to everyone's surprise, the mechanical body Umamusume did not react to the environment on the "Exquisite"."
uma_bour_arc.32.a: "Bad"
uma_bour_arc.33.title: "What interface?"
uma_bour_arc.33.desc: "During a routine check today, the researchers found a subtle change in the database of the mechanical body Umamusume, and some of the miscellaneous data was actually combined into a new interface, which is obviously a high-level encryption method, and we don't even know the conditions of this interface.\nThe researchers connected anyway."

uma_bour_arc.42.title: "Scientists in the database"
uma_bour_arc.42.desc: "The fact that K was in Mihono's database made sense, but it still sent all the scientists who knew about it running around in excitement, and they couldn't wait to talk to each other in a month.\nPrior to this, sporadic conversations with her had led us to understand that Mihono's factor was present in Tresen, and that we might be able to do something about it."

She has demonstrated her extraordinary talent and will undoubtedly be a powerful force in our quest to discover the truth about the universe.\nWe successfully referenced Mihono's factor data to find the "reincarnated" Mihono, named "Mihono Bourbon", who is now a member of the Tresen Academy and is about to start her own career as a seumamusume. [This.GetGlxName] examined her thoroughly, but it did not seem to meet expectations.\nIn addition, this year's list of Umamusume also has a "§BRice Shower§!" Umamusume, as it happens, her representative element is §B Blue Rose §! It was consistent with the findings in Santance, and even its domain data was close to that of the Blue Rose."

She planned to enter a higher management school, but according to a personal survey, she seemed to want to work in the private sector rather than the government.\nIn Bourbon's case, we were even more surprised that, although she excelled in the engineering school, she seemed to be too immersed in ancient machinery, and spent almost all of her spare time studying various applications of electronic and mechanical structures from 100 years ago, and the engineering professors expressed concern to us."

However, this status quo seems to be about to change, Mihono Bourbon's research on modern electromechanical structures was initially regarded as ignorant, but one by one, the efficient structure has been improved to break her doubts, and these structures can even feed the progress of cutting-edge technology.\nOn the other hand, Rice Shower determined her goal to join the civil activities and founded the prestigious "Colonial Planet Mutual Aid Association" after graduation, which is committed to providing a good growth environment for the new Umamusume on the colonial planet and coordinating colonial relations.\nIn resource-poor colonies, there was often a need for more classic but practical mechanical structures, which greatly stretched the distance between Bourbon and Rice Shower, and the needs of various colonies were transferred to mutual aid societies, Bourbon developed suitable mechanical structures, and her inspiration seemed endless."
