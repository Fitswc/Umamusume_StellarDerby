#Use this format:
#	text = {
#		localization_key = GFX_leader_bg_official # Bg key goes here.
# 		trigger = { <whatever > } # Scope is the leader.
#	}
# Note:
# 1 The leader BGs must be defined separately, at root/interface/portraits/filename.gfx (dont have to replace/overwrite leaders.gfx)
# 2 backgrounds should go in gfx/interface/portraits, with a resolution of 320 x 380 px, 32bpp DDS unsigned, no mipmaps.
# 3 the bottom 1/3 of the image should be darkened/faded for the leader origin UI / text to overlay nicely.

# NOTE: Paragon BGs defined before this inline is called, so they always superceede the below, and base class BGs defined after it's called - so they act as fallbacks
